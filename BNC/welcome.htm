<ul><li><b>BNC XML Edition: the corpus</b> 
<br>The BNC is a 100 million word snapshot of British English at the end of the 
  twentieth century, made up of over 4000 distinct &quot;texts&quot;, spoken and written, 
  sampled from a wide range of different kinds of writing. The XML
		  Edition is an enhanced and revised version of the
original BNC World Edition, containing additional linguistic annotation, and
		  many corrections. 		 </li>
<li><b>The BNC Users Reference Guide</b>
<br/>This detailed
  manual describes the corpus design and contents, with full reference 
  information about its encoding scheme, and suggestions for how to
		  process and manage it with freely available standard
	      software tools. Any XML aware software
		  can be used to access the XML files making up the
		  corpus, once it has been unpacked. </li>

<ul>
<li><b>Xaira</b><br>The BNC XML package was previously supplied on disks
with a set of pre-built Xaira indexes which enable you to start searching the 
corpus straight away with Xaira, a powerful open source XML indexing and 
searching software system, designed especially for use with the BNC. However,
the University of Oxford, who distributes the corpus, is not able to 
support Xaira, nor ensure that the latest version of the software and indexed data
are available. You can find out more about Xaira, including software downloads, from <a href="http://www.xaira.org">http://www.xaira.org</a>.

<li>To copy the uncompressed corpus texts you will need about 4.7 GB of free diskspace.</li>
<li>No software is provided with the corpus, so there are no further system requirements.</li>
