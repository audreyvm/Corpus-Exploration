BUT I DON'T DO WINDOWS!

BNC-XML can also be installed on non-Windows platforms. The corpus
itself is in a non-proprietary format, and the Xaira indexes supplied
are platform-independent. These notes describe briefly how to install
the corpus from the supplied media, and how to set up a Xaira server
on a Linux or OS X platform.

1. READ THE LICENCE

Whatever platform you intend to install the BNC on, you are still
required to observe the terms of the Licence you purchased when you
obtained your copy of the Corpus. The BNC data is protected by
United Kingdom copyright laws, international treaty provisions, and
other applicable national laws. The owners of the copyright retain all
rights not expressly granted. By making use of the BNC Data on your
system you indicate your acceptance of the terms and conditions
relating to the British National Corpus, stated below. 

The BNC Licence constitutes a legal agreement between You
("the Licensee") and the British National Corpus Consortium
("the Licensor"), as legal owner of the British National
Corpus, which is a UK-registered trademark. Oxford University
Computing Services ("the Distributor") has been appointed
sole licensed Distributor of the British National Corpus and is
authorised to collect and enforce such agreements.

The full text of the Licence Agreement is available from
http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/getting/licence.html and is also attached
below. If you do not accept its terms and conditions, you must
delete the Data from your system and dispose of the media.

2.  UNPACK THE CORPUS

The corpus is supplied as a GZIPped TAR archive on the DVD called
texts.tar.gz on BNC-XML-1. We recommend unpacking it into a directory
called Texts. Assuming you have mounted this disk at /media/cdrom,
open a shell window and type:

$mkdir Texts
$cd Texts
$gunzip -xvf /media/cdrom/texts.tar.gz

This should produce 10 subdirectories, A to K (there is no I, to
avoid confusing it with J), each of which contains a varying number of
sub-subdirectories, within which are the actual corpus files, as
further described in the User Reference Guide.


3. GET THE DOCUMENTATION

The directory Doc on BNC-XML-1 contains a copy of the user reference
guide, which you will probably want to copy to your system as
well. The directory Doc/Src contains the XML source, which will
probably interest you less than the HTML produced from it which is in
the directory Doc/HTML.

If you plan to process the XML source of the corpus in any way,
you'll probably want to copy the directory XML from BNC-XML-1 as
well. This contains schema files, expressed in DTD, RelaxNG, and WSD,
and also a folder called Scripts, which contains the sample XSLT
scripts mentioned in the documentation.


4. INSTALL XAIRA INDEXES

If you want to set up a Xaira server you will need to install
Xaira Indexes, and (possibly) build the Xaira server software. We
don't describe the latter in much detail here: refer to the
documentation on the Xaira website at http://www.xaira.org
The recommended directory structure for a Xaira server installation
has everything grouped together within a single hierarchy. If you make
the root of this a directory called BNC-XML, within it you will need
three subdirectories:

Texts : contains the corpus texts you copied in step 1 above
Etc : contains a small number of support files needed by the server
Index : contains the Xaira  index files

and (at the same level) three XML  files:

corpus_parameters.xml : startup file for the server
bncHdr.xml : the corpus header file
bncBibl.xml : the corpus bibliography file


You can create this structure in two steps. First, assuming you
created the root directory BNC-XML and have already unpacked the Texts
directory into it, unpacking the file bnc-etc.tar from the disk
BNC-XML-1 will create the Etc directory and the three XML files for
you:

$cd /BNC-XML
$tar -xf /media/cdrom/bnc-etc.tar

Secondly, you will need to create the Index directory and populate
it. Because of their size, the index files are spread across the two
DVDs, so take care when copying them or you may find yourself
with only a partial index. We recommend you proceed as follows :

*  with the first DVD in the drive, create the Index directory and
   copy files from the first DVD:

   $cd /BNC-XML
   $mkdir Index
   $cp /media/cdrom0/Index/* Index

*  unmount the first DVD and mount the second DVD: it should appear
   as BNC-XML-2. Then copy the remaining index files from the
   directory  Index2 on the second DVD:
    
    $cp /media/cdrom0/Index/* Index

At the end of this process, if all goes well, your Index folder
should contain 17 files, including four big files xdblocs, xdblocs1 and
xdblocs2 copied from the second DVD.

5.  Run XAIRA

Information about the XAIRA software system is available from the
project's website at http://www.xaira.org and the software itself may
be downloaded from SourceForge.  We do not describe here in any detail
how to install or run the Xaira software on non-Windows platforms, but
the following brief notes may help you get started.


* If you are running a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, you should
be able to install xaira from binaries, using the packages maintained
at http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/teideb

* Alternatively, building from source is not hard: download the source
code from SourceForge, configure, and make, as usual. But note that
you also need to install and build ICU and xercesc (and possibly also
some other libraries such as GNU readline and zlib)

* Once you have successfully built the software, you can check your
installation of BNC-XML by running the command-line solve client
within your BNC-XML directory : 

  $cd /BNC-XML solve -p corpus_parameters.xml

expects you to type Xaira queries at the prompt and returns a stream
of hits as XML: try for example

  <cql><lemma>fishcake</lemma></cql>

to see the one occurrence of "fishcake" in the BNC. Do
not try this with a high frequency word!

* If you have PHP installed, you can use the Xaira library as a back
end to access your copy of BNC-XML over the web. Information on how to
configure PHP and demonstration scripts are included in the source
release and documented on the website.

* Use the xaira_daemon command to start a xaira server:

   $cd /BNC-XML
   $xaira_daemon -p corpus_parameters.xml -l 20200

will start a server running on port 20200. Firewalls permitting, you
should be able to point Xaira clients, such as those provided by the
Windows release, at it.
