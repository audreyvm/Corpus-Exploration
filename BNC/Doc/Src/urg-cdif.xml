<div xml:id="cdif21"><head>Divisions of written texts</head> 

<p>Written texts exhibit a rich variety of different structural
forms. Some have very little organization at levels higher than the
paragraphs; others may have a complex hierarchy of parts, sections,
chapters etc. Novels are divided into chapters, newspapers into
sections, reference works into articles and so forth. In the BNC all
such structural divisions are represnted uniformly by means of the
<gi>div</gi> element.

<specList>
<specDesc key="div" atts="n level type"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>In written texts, the <att>n</att> attribute is sometimes used to supply an
identifying name or number used within the text for a given division,
for example, a chapter number, as in the following example: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="three" level="1">...</div>
</egXML>More often, however, chapter names or numbers will appear within
the text, tagged using the <gi>head</gi> element discussed in section
<ptr target="#cdif51"/> below. </p>
<p>The value of the attribute <att>type</att> is used to
characterise the function of the textual division (see the <ref
target="./urg.html#div">reference documentation</ref> for the values used). If a value is supplied for one
division at a given level, it may be assumed to apply to all
subsequent divisions at the same level until the end of the enclosing
element, although it is not always explicitly specified.
</p>
<p>Where <gi>div</gi> levels are nested, for example where the
chapters of a novel are grouped into parts each of which may have its own
title or number, the <att>level</att> attribute is used to
indicate the depth of nesting. This is not strictly necessary (since
an XML-aware processor retains this information) but has been added
for the convenience of users of previous versions of the corpus, in
which the level was explicitly coded into the name of the surrounding
element (<gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi> etc.) </p>
<p>In text ANY, for example, each chapter of the original novel
corresponds with a <gi>div level="2"</gi>, because the work contains
groups of chapters, each of which begins with a page containing
just a date. The opening
of the text is therefore encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><wtext type="FICTION">
<div level="1" n="1">
  <s n="1">
    <w c5="NP0" hw="monday" pos="SUBST">Monday</w>
    <c c5="PUN">, </c>
    <w c5="NP0" hw="january" pos="SUBST">January </w>
    <w c5="ORD" hw="13th" pos="ADJ">13th</w>
    <c c5="PUN">, </c>
     <w c5="CRD" hw="1986" pos="ADJ">1986</w>
     <c c5="PUN">.</c>
  </s>
  <div level="2" n="1">
  <p>
  <s n="2">
     <w c5="NP0" hw="victor" pos="SUBST">Victor </w>
     <w c5="NP0" hw="wilcox" pos="SUBST">Wilcox </w>    
     <w c5="VVZ" hw="lie" pos="VERB">lies </w>
     <w c5="AJ0" hw="awake" pos="ADJ">awake</w>
...
  </s></p></div></div>...</wtext><!-- ANY --></egXML></p>
<p>Note however that in some texts initial sentences (like <q>Monday, January
13th, 1986</q> above) may have been misplaced, so that they appear at the start
of an inner <gi>div</gi> rather than the start of its parent.</p>
<p>A sequence of paragraph-level elements of arbitrary length may
precede the first structural subdivision at any level. A text may have
no structural divisions within it at all. Note that any prefatory or
appended matter not forming part of a text will not generally be
captured: the <abbr>tei</abbr> elements <gi>front</gi> and
<gi>back</gi> elements are not used. <!--  by <abbr>cdif</abbr>.  -->
</p></div>

<div xml:id="cdif5"><head>Paragraph-level elements and chunks</head> 

<p>Written texts may be organized into structural units containing more
than one <gi>s</gi> element and smaller than any of the divisions
discussed in section <ptr target="#cdif21"/> above. The most commonly
found such element is the <gi>p</gi> (paragraph):

<specList>
<specDesc key="p"/>
</specList>

Several other elements may however appear directly within <gi>div</gi>
or within <gi>text</gi> elements, not nested within some other element
such as a paragraph. An list of these elements
follows:

<specList>
<specDesc key="head"  atts="type rend"/>
<specDesc key="quote" atts="rend"/><!-- has model macro.specialPara -->
<specDesc key="sp" atts="who"/>
<specDesc key="lg"/>
<specDesc key="list"/>
<specDesc key="note" atts="place n"/>
<specDesc key="bibl" atts="rend"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>Each of these elements contains one or more <gi>s</gi> elements, as
discussed above; in some cases enclosed by an intermediate
element. They are used chiefly to indicate the function of sections of
the text, as indicated in the list above. </p>

<p>The following sections provide examples for the use of each of
these elements.</p>

<div xml:id="cdif51" type="bum"><head>Headings and captions</head> 

<p> One or more <gi>head</gi> elements of specified types may appear in sequence at the
start of any <gi>div</gi> element, or at the start of a <gi>list</gi> or
<gi>poem</gi>, as in the following examples:. 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div level="1" n="1">
<head type="MAIN">
  <s n="1"><w c5="NN1" hw="ageism" pos="SUBST">AGEISM</w></s>
</head>
<head type="SUB">
<s n="2">
  <w c5="AT0" hw="the" pos="ART">THE </w>
  <w c5="NN1" hw="foundation" pos="SUBST">FOUNDATION </w>
  <w c5="PRF" hw="of" pos="PREP">OF </w>
  <w c5="NN1" hw="age" pos="SUBST">AGE </w>
  <w c5="NN1" hw="discrimination" pos="SUBST">DISCRIMINATION</w></s>
</head>
<head type="BYLINE">
<s n="3">
  <w c5="NP0" hw="steve" pos="SUBST">STEVE </w>
  <w c5="NP0-NN1" hw="scrutton" pos="SUBST">SCRUTTON</w></s>
</head>...</div><!-- B01  --></egXML>
</p>
<p>As shown above, the <att>type</att> attribute is used to distinguish more
exactly the function of a heading.</p>

<p>Note that, in the BNC, captions or headings which <q>float</q> within the text,
that is, which appear elsewhere than at the very beginning of the
section which they name, are not encoded as <gi>head</gi> elements. A <gi>head</gi> element
can appear only at the start of a text division and is logically
associated with it (for example, chapter titles, newspaper headlines
etc.). Paragraphs which provide heading or captioning information,
but which are logically independent of
their position within a textual division (for example,
captions attached to pictures or figures,
or <q>pull-quotes</q> embedded within the text) are represented in the same way as any other
paragraph of text, using the <gi>p</gi> element, but specifying the
value <code>caption</code> in their rend attribute.</p>

<!-- update example please -->

<p>In the following example, the <gi>head</gi> element is followed by
a number of captions introducing particular parts of
a magazine story: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div level="1"><head>
<s n="40"><w c5="NN2" hw="trousers" pos="SUBST">TROUSERS </w><w c5="VVB-NN1" hw="suit" pos="VERB">SUIT</w></s></head><p type="caption">

</div>

<div xml:id="cdif52"><head>Quotations</head> 

<p>A quotation is an extract from some other work than the text itself
which is embedded within it, for example as an epigraph or illustration.
It is marked up using the <gi>quote</gi> element. This may contain any
combination of other chunks (for example paragraphs, poems, lists) but
may not directly contain <gi>w</gi> or <gi>s</gi> elements. A reference for the
citation may also be contained within it.
</p>
<p>For example: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><quote><p>

</p></div>

<div xml:id="cdif5x"><head>Spoken paragraphs</head> 

<p>As noted above, the <gi>sp</gi> element is used to mark parts of a
written text which were or are intended to be spoken, for example the
speeches in a dramatic text or a published interview. Such parts are
generally readily identifiable by the use of such conventions as speaker
prefixes (the label supplying the name of the speaker) and stage
directions, for which the following additional elements are used:
<!-- is @who ever used on sp? if not, delete it; if so exemplify it -->
<specList>
<specDesc key="speaker"/>
<specDesc key="stage" atts="rend"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>sp</gi> element is used only for speech which is presented
as such in a written text, by contrast with  the element <gi>u</gi>
discussed in section <ptr target="#cdifspu"/>, which is used <emph>only</emph>
for speaker turns identified in a spoken text, i.e. one which has been
transcribed from audio tape.
</p>
<p>If present, a <gi>speaker</gi> element will  appear only at the start of
the
<gi>sp</gi> element, followed by one or more <gi>p</gi> elements
containing the actual speech. <!--Any <gi>stage</gi> element present will
usually be relocated to the end of the paragraph in which it occurs and
replaced by a <gi>ptr</gi> element, as  discussed in section <ptr target="#cdifptr"/>. -->
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a stage direction occurring within a speech:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp>
<p>
<s n="1115">
  <w c5="CRD" hw="seven" pos="ADJ">Seven </w>
  <w c5="NN2" hw="book" pos="SUBST">books </w>

<div xml:id="cdif53"><head>Poetry</head> 

<p>Poetry is distinguished from prose in the BNC where it is so
presented in the original, for example as fragments of verse or song appearing within or
between paragraphs of prose. The <gi>l</gi> (line) element is used to mark each
verse line; where there are several such lines, perhaps with a
heading, they are grouped together using the <gi>lg</gi> (linegroup) element, and any title or heading present is marked with a
<gi>head</gi> element. </p>
<p>For example: 

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg><l>
<s n="906"><w c5="PNP" hw="i" pos="PRON">I </w><w c5="VVB" hw="send" pos="VERB">send </w><w c5="DPS" hw="i" pos="PRON">my </w><w c5="NN1" hw="soul" pos="SUBST">soul </w><w c5="PRP" hw="through" pos="PREP">through </w><w c5="NN1" hw="time" pos="SUBST">time </w><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">and </w><w c5="NN1-VVB" hw="space" pos="SUBST">space </w><w c5="TO0" hw="to" pos="PREP">to </w><w c5="VVI" hw="greet" pos="VERB">greet </w><w c5="PNP" hw="you" pos="PRON">you</w><c c5="PUN">.</c></s></l><l>

</p>
<p>Note that the <gi>l</gi> element is not used to mark typographic
lineation. Layout information is not, in general, preserved in the BNC.</p></div>

<div xml:id="cdif54"><head>Lists</head> 
<p>A list is a collection of distinct items flagged as such by special 
layout  in written texts, often functioning as a single  syntactic unit.
 Lists may appear within or between paragraphs. Where marked, lists are
tagged with the <gi>list</gi> element, which may contain the following
subelements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="head" />
<specDesc key="label" atts="rend"/>
<specDesc key="item" atts="rend"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>A <gi>list</gi> element consists of an optional <gi>head</gi>
element, followed by one or more <gi>item</gi> elements, each of which
may optionally be preceded by a <gi>label</gi> element, used to hold
the identifier or tag sometimes attached to a list item, for example
<q>(a)</q>.  It may also contain a word or phrase used for a similar
purpose.
</p>

<p>The <gi>item</gi> element may appear only inside lists. It contains
the same mixture of elements as a paragraph,  and may thus contain one
or more nested lists. It may also contains a series of paragraphs, each
marked with a <gi>p</gi> element.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple list:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list><item>

<div xml:id="cdif55"><head>Notes and citations</head> 

<p>Annotations occurring in written texts, and bibliographic citations

<p>Original notes may contain any mixture of other chunks, and may also

<div xml:id="cdifbib"><head>Bibliographic references</head>

<p>Bibliographic citations or references within running texts may also
be marked, using the <gi>bibl</gi> element; in the present version of
the corpus this is done in some texts
only.
<!--
<p>Bibliographic citations or references are very frequent in some kinds
of writing, and almost entirely absent from others. It is useful to
distinguish them from surrounding text, both because they have a very
different linguistic structure, and for information retrieval purposes.
The optional <gi>bibl</gi> element should contain the whole of any
bibliographic citation distinguished in a text, including, for example,
page and volume numbers.  <p>Some constituents of the citation may also
be tagged in their own right, using the appropriate phrase-level tags
(<gi>title</gi>, <gi>name</gi>, <gi>date</gi> etc.) but
<abbr>cdif</abbr> does not require or enforce this. The <gi>bibl</gi>
element contains any sequence of phrase-level elements.
--> 
</p>
<p>For example: <!-- -->

<p>Note that the <gi>bibl</gi> element used within corpus texts has
none of the more detailed sub-elements described for it in <ptr

subsection, the <gi>bibl</gi> element appearing within corpus texts
contains only <gi>s</gi> elements. </p>
</div>


</div>
<div xml:id="cdif6"><head>Phrase-level elements</head> 

<p>Phrase-level elements are elements which cannot appear directly
within a textual division, but must be contained by some other element.
In practice, this means they will be contained within an <gi>s</gi>
element. In addition to the <gi>w</gi>, <gi>mw</gi>, and <gi>c</gi> elements
already discussed, only the following phrase-level elements  appear within
<gi>s</gi> elements in written texts:

<specDesc key="pb" atts="n"/>
<specDesc key="hi" atts="rend"/>
</specList>
</p>

<div><head>Page breaks</head>

<p>Wherever possible, the original pagination and page numbering of the source text
has been preserved. The <gi>pb</gi> element is used to mark the
approximate position in the text at which each new page starts, and
its <att>n</att> attribute supplies the number of the page.

<div xml:id="cdif62"><head>Highlighted phrases</head> 
<p>Typographic changes or highlighting in the original may not be marked in the
transcript at all. Alternatively, highlighted phrases, and the kind of
highlighting used, may be recorded in one of two ways: 
<list>
<item>using the <att>rend</att> (rendition) attribute on elements
for which this is defined
</item>
<item>using the <gi>hi</gi> (highlighted) element
</item> 
</list></p>
<p>The former is used where the whole of the content of one of the
elements <gi>bibl</gi>, <gi>corr</gi>, <gi>div</gi>, <gi>head</gi>,
<gi>item</gi>, <gi>l</gi>, <gi>label</gi>, <gi>list</gi>, <gi>p</gi>,
<gi>quote</gi> or <gi>stage</gi> is highlighted. The latter is
used on all other occasions. The values available for the <att>rend</att>
attribute in either case and their significance are as listed in the
<ref target="./urg.html#att.rendered">reference documentation</ref> in
all cases.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the purpose of the <att>rend</att>
attribute is <emph>not</emph> to provide information adequate to the
needs of a typesetter, but simply to record some qualitative information
about the original. </p>
<p>Like all other phrase-level elements, each <gi>hi</gi> element must
be entirely contained by an <gi>s</gi> element.  This implies that
where, for example, a bolded passage contains more than one sentence, or
an italicised phrase begins in one verse line and ends in another, the
<gi>hi</gi> element must be closed at the end of the enclosing element,
and then re-opened within the next. 
</p>


<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>For example, in the following four lines of verse, the first three
are rendered in italics, and the <att>rend</att> attribute is
therefore specified for each <gi>l</gi> element. In the fourth line,
only the first few words are in italics: a <gi>hi</gi> element must be
used within the <gi>l</gi> to carry this information.

<div xml:id="cdifsp"><head>Spoken texts</head> 

<div xml:id="cdif22"><head>Basic structure: spoken texts</head> 

<p>The spoken material transcribed for the BNC  is also organized into
<soCalled>texts</soCalled>, which are subdivided into
<soCalled>divisions</soCalled>, made up of <gi>w</gi> and <gi>mw</gi>
elements grouped into <gi>s</gi> elements in the same way as  written
texts. However there a number of other elements specific to spoken
texts, and their hierarchic organization is naturally not the same as that of
written texts. For this reason, a different element (<gi>stext</gi>)
is used to represent a spoken text.
</p>
<p>In demographically sampled spoken texts, each distinct conversation
recorded by a given respondent is treated as a distinct <gi>div</gi>
element. All the conversations from a single respondent are then
grouped together to form a single <gi>stext</gi>
element. Context-governed spoken texts, however, do not use the
<gi>div</gi> element: the <gi>stext</gi> element for a context
governed text is composed only of <gi>u</gi> elements, not grouped
into any unit smaller than the <gi>stext</gi> itself. </p>

<p>The <gi>s</gi> elements making up a spoken text are grouped not
into <gi>p</gi> or other similar elements, but instead into <gi>u</gi>
elements. Each <gi>u</gi> (utterance) element marks a stretch of
uninterrupted speech from a given speaker; (see section <ptr
target="#cdifspu"/>). Interspersed within and between <gi>u</gi>
elements, a variety of other
elements indicate para-linguistic phenomena noticed
by the transcribers (see section <ptr target="#cdifspp"/>). </p>

<!-- can we put this somewhere more accessible? -->

<p>The methods and principles applied in transcription and
normalisation of speech are defined in a BNC working paper TGCW21
<title>Spoken Corpus Transcription Guide</title>, and have also been
described in subsequent publications (e.g. Crowdy 1994). The editorial tags
discussed in section <ptr target="#cdifed"/> above are also used to
represent normalisation practice when dealing with transcribed speech.
</p>
</div>

<div xml:id="cdifspu" type="subsubsect"><head>Utterances</head> 

<p>The term  <term>utterance</term> is used in the BNC to refer to a
continuous stretch of speech produced
by one participant in a
conversation, or by a group of participants. Structurally, the
corresponding element behaves in a similar way to the <gi>p</gi>
element in a written text — it groups a sequence of <gi>s</gi>
elements together.
<specList>
<specDesc key="u" atts="who"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>The  <att>who</att> attribute is required on every <gi>u</gi>: its function is to
identify the person or group of people making the utterance, using the
unique code defined for that person in the appropriate section of the
header.  A simple example follows: 

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="PS1LW">
<s n="159"><w c5="ITJ" hw="mm" pos="INTERJ">Mm </w><w c5="ITJ" hw="mm" pos="INTERJ">mm</w><c c5="PUN">.</c></s></u><!-- F7F --></egXML> The code <code>PS1LW</code> used here will be specified as
the value for the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of some <gi>person</gi>
element within the header of the text from which this example is
taken.  Where the speaker cannot be confidently identified, or where
there is more than one aspeaker, a special
code is used; see further discussion at <ptr target="#persdis"/>.

<!--
For example, if text <att>xyz</att> contains two different but
unidentified speakers, one of them will be given the identifier
<att>XYZSP001</att>, and the other <att>XYZSP002</att>. A
group of unidenified speakers speaking together in the text will be given an
identifier -->

<!-- check and give examples -->
</p>
</div>
<div xml:id="cdifspp"><head>Paralinguistic phenomena</head> 
<p>In transcribing spoken language, it is necessary to select from the
possibly very large set of distinct paralinguistic phenomena which might
be of interest. In the texts transcribed for the BNC, encoders were
instructed to mark the following such phenomena:
<list type="gloss"><label>voice quality</label>
<item>for example, whispering, laughing, etc., both as discrete events
and as changes in voice quality affecting passages within an utterance.</item>

<label>non-verbal but vocalised sounds</label>
<item>for example, coughs, humming noises etc. </item> 
<label>non-verbal and non-vocal events</label>
<item>for example passing lorries, animal noises,  and other matters
considered worthy of note.
</item> 
<label>significant pauses</label>
<item>silence, within or between utterances, longer than  was judged
normal for the speaker or speakers.
</item>
<label>unclear passages</label>
<item>whole utterances or passages within them which were inaudible or
incomprehensible for a variety of reasons.</item>
<label>speech management phenomena</label>
<item>for example truncation, false starts, and correction.</item>
<label>overlap</label>
<item>points at which more than one speaker was active.</item>
</list>    Other aspects of spoken texts are not explicitly recorded in
the encoding, although their headers contain considerable amounts of
situational and participant information. 
</p>
<p>In many cases, because no standardized set of descriptions was predefined,
transcribers gave very widely differing accounts of the same
phenomena. An attempt has however been made to normalize the descriptions for
some of these elements in the BNC XML editions.</p>

<p>The elements used to mark these phenomena are listed below in
alphabetical order:
<specList>
<specDesc key="event" atts="desc dur"/>
<specDesc key="pause" atts="dur"/>
<specDesc key="shift" atts="new"/>
<specDesc key="trunc" />
<specDesc key="unclear" atts="dur"/>
<specDesc key="vocal" atts="desc dur who"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The value of the <att>dur</att> attribute is normally specified
only if it is greater than 5 seconds, and its accuracy is only
approximate.  </p>
<p>With the exception of the <gi>trunc</gi> element, which is a
special case of the editorial tags discussed in section <ptr target="#cdifed"/> above, all of these elements are empty, and may appear anywhere within
a transcription. 
</p>
<p>The following example shows an event, several pauses and a patch of
unclear speech:



<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s n="5490"><event desc="radio on"/><pause dur="34"/><w c5="PNP" hw="you" pos="PRON">You </w><w c5="VVN" hw="get" pos="VERB">got</w><w c5="TO0" hw="ta" pos="PREP">ta  </w><unclear/><w c5="NN1" hw="radio" pos="SUBST">Radio </w><w c5="CRD" hw="two" pos="ADJ">Two </w><w c5="PRP" hw="with" pos="PREP">with </w><w c5="DT0" hw="that" pos="ADJ">that</w><c c5="PUN">.</c></s>
<s n="5491"><pause dur="6"/><w c5="AJ0" hw="bloody" pos="ADJ">Bloody
</w><w c5="NN1" hw="pirate" pos="SUBST">pirate </w><w c5="NN1"
hw="station" pos="SUBST">station </w><w c5="VM0" hw="would"
pos="VERB">would</w><w c5="XX0" hw="not" pos="ADV">n't </w><w c5="PNP"
hw="you" pos="PRON">you</w><c c5="PUN">?</c></s>
<!-- KB2 --></egXML> </p>
<p>Where the whole of an utterance is unclear, that is, where no speech
has actually been transcribed, the <gi>unclear</gi> element is used on
its own, with an optional <att>who</att> attribute to indicate who
is speaking, if this is identifiable. For example: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="xx"><s>....</s></u>
<unclear who="yy"/>
<u who="xx"><s>... </s></u></egXML>
Here YY's remarks, whatever they are, are too unclear to be
transcribed, and so no <gi>u</gi> element is provided. 
</p>

<!-- update -->
<p>The values used for the <att>desc</att> attribute of the
<gi>event</gi> element are not constrained in the current version of
the corpus, and more than a thousand different values exist in the
corpus. Some common examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><event desc="laughter"/>
<event desc="telephone noise"/>
</egXML> 
A list of the most frequent values is given in <ptr target="#eventcodes"/>.
</p>
<p>As noted above, a distinction is made between discrete vocal events,
such as laughter, and changes in voice quality, such as words which are
spoken in a laughing tone. The former are encoded using the
<gi>vocal</gi> element, as in the following example: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="PS09T">
<s n="4307"><vocal desc="laugh"/><c c5="PUN">, </c><w c5="PNP" hw="you" pos="PRON">you</w><w c5="VM0" hw="will" pos="VERB">'ll </w><w c5="VHI" hw="have" pos="VERB">have </w><w c5="TO0" hw="to" pos="PREP">to </w><w c5="VVI" hw="take" pos="VERB">take </w><w c5="DT0-CJT" hw="that" pos="ADJ">that </w><w c5="AVP-PRP" hw="off" pos="ADV">off </w><w c5="AV0" hw="there" pos="ADV">there  </w><vocal desc="laugh"/><w c5="ITJ" hw="yeah" pos="INTERJ">yeah </w><w c5="PNP" hw="you" pos="PRON">you </w><w c5="VM0" hw="can" pos="VERB">can   </w><pause/><vocal desc="laugh"/><pause/></s></u><!-- KC2 --></egXML>  The <gi>shift</gi> element is used instead where the laughter
indicates a change in voice quality, as in the following example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="PS01V">
<s n="4188"><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">And </w><w c5="UNC" hw="erm" pos="UNC">erm  </w><pause/><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">and </w><w c5="AV0" hw="then" pos="ADV">then </w><w c5="PNP" hw="we" pos="PRON">we </w><w c5="VVD" hw="go" pos="VERB">went </w><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">and </w><w c5="VVD" hw="get" pos="VERB">got </w><w c5="DPS" hw="i" pos="PRON">my </w><w c5="NN0" hw="fruit" pos="SUBST">fruit </w><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">and </w><w c5="NN1" hw="veg" pos="SUBST">veg </w><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">and </w><w c5="AV0" hw="then" pos="ADV">then </w><w c5="PNP" hw="we" pos="PRON">we </w><w c5="VVD" hw="go" pos="VERB">went </w><w c5="PRP" hw="in" pos="PREP">in </w><w c5="AJ0-NN1" hw="top" pos="ADJ">Top </w><w c5="NP0" hw="marks" pos="SUBST">Marks </w><w c5="CJC" hw="and" pos="CONJ">and </w><w c5="VVD" hw="get" pos="VERB">got </w><w c5="PNP" hw="they" pos="PRON">them  </w><shift new="laughing"/><w c5="AV0" hw="so" pos="ADV">so </w><w c5="PNP" hw="we" pos="PRON">we </w><w c5="AV0" hw="never" pos="ADV">never </w><w c5="VVD" hw="get" pos="VERB">got  </w><shift/><w c5="PNP" hw="we" pos="PRON">we </w><w c5="VVD" hw="go" pos="VERB">went </w><w c5="AVP" hw="through" pos="ADV">through </w><w c5="PRP" hw="for" pos="PREP">for </w><w c5="AT0" hw="a" pos="ART">a </w><w c5="NN1" hw="video" pos="SUBST">video </w><w c5="AV0" hw="really" pos="ADV">really</w><c c5="PUN">, </c><w c5="AV0" hw="never" pos="ADV">never </w><w c5="VVN-VVD" hw="get" pos="VERB">got </w><w c5="AVP" hw="round" pos="ADV">round </w><w c5="PRP" hw="to" pos="PREP">to </w><w c5="VVG" hw="look" pos="VERB">looking </w><w c5="PRP" hw="for" pos="PREP">for </w><w c5="AT0" hw="a" pos="ART">a </w><w c5="NN1" hw="video" pos="SUBST">video </w><w c5="VDD" hw="do" pos="VERB">did </w><w c5="PNP" hw="we" pos="PRON">we</w><c c5="PUN">?</c></s></u><!-- KB2 --></egXML></p>
<p>When no
 <att>new</att> attribute is supplied on a
<gi>shift</gi> element, the meaning is that the voice quality
indicated reverts to a normal or unmarked state. Hence, in this example,
the passage between the tags <gi>shift new="laughing"/</gi>
and <gi>shift/</gi> is spoken with a laughing intonation
</p>
<p>A list of values currently used for the <att>new</att>
attribute is given below in section <ptr target="#shiftcodes"/>.
</p>
<!-- examples of trunc etc needed here -->
</div>

<div xml:id="cdif632"><head>Alignment of overlapping speech</head>  
<p>By default it is assumed that the events represented in a
transcription are non-overlapping and that they are transcribed in
temporal sequence.  That is, unless otherwise specified, it is implied
that the end of one utterance precedes the start of the next following
it in the text, perhaps with an interposed <gi>pause</gi> element.
Where this is not the case, the following element is used: 

<specList>
<specDesc key="align" atts="with"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The <att>with</att> attribute of an <gi>align</gi> element
may be thought of as identifying some point in time. Where two or
more <gi>align</gi> elements specify the same value for this
attribute, their locations are assumed to be synchronised.
</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates how this mechanism is used to
indicate that one speaker's attempt to take the floor has been
unsuccessful:
