<div class="teidiv1" id="overview">
<h3>6.1  Introduction</h3>
<p><span id="id2356060"></span>The wordclass tagging<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note2"><sup>2</sup></a>
has not changed significantly between the BNC World edition (2001) and
the BNC XML edition (2006). In particular, no attempt has been made to
completely retag the corpus, desirable though this might be.  Changes
have been made in the treatment of multiword units and some additional
annotation has been provided (see <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#extra-annot" title="Additional annotation in BNC XML">6.6.4.7  Additional annotation in BNC XML</a> , but
in most respects the wordclass information provided by the corpus now
is identical to that provided with the first release of the BNC in
1994.
  </p>
<p><span id="id2356083"></span> The BNC is wordclass-tagged using a set of 57 tags (known as C5)
 which we refer to as the "BNC Basic Tagset". (There are also 4
 punctuation tags, excluded from consideration here.) Each C5 tag
 represents a grammatical class of words represented by a three
 character code such as <tt>NN1</tt> for
 "singular common noun". The codes are, in many cases, mnemonic.</p>
<p><span id="id2356097"></span>The BNC, consisting of c.100 million words, was tagged
automatically, using the CLAWS4 automatic tagger developed by Roger
Garside at Lancaster, and a second program, known as Template Tagger,
developed by Mike Pacey and Steve Fligelstone. Further details are given <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#prog" title="POS-Tagging Workflow">below</a>, and also in <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Garside
and Leech 1997</a>
chapters 7-9.  With such a large corpus, there was no opportunity to
undertake post-editing<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note3"><sup>3</sup></a> i.e. disambiguation and
correction of tagging errors produced by the automatic tagger, and so
the errors (about 1.15 per cent of all words) remain. In addition, 
the corpus contains ambiguous taggings (c.3.75 per cent of all words),
shown in the form of ambiguity tags (also called &#8216;portmanteau tags&#8217;),
consisting of two C5 tags linked by a hyphen:
e.g. <tt>VVD-VVN</tt>. These tags indicate that the automatic
tagger was unable to determine, with sufficient confidence, which was
the correct category, and so left two possibilities for users to
disambiguate themselves, if they should wish to do so. For example, in
the case of <tt>VVD-VVN</tt>, the first (more likely) tag, say for a word such as
<i>wanted</i>, is <tt>VVD</tt>: past tense of lexical verb; and the second (less
likely) tag is <tt>VVN</tt>: past participle of lexical verb. On the whole,
the likelihood of the first tag of an ambiguity tag being correct is
better than 3 to 1 &#8212; see, however, details of individual tags in <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-1" title="">Table 23. Estimated ambiguity and error rates for the whole corpus (fine-grained calculation)</a> of the error report document.  </p>
<p><span id="id2341254"></span> After the automatic tagging, some manual tagging was undertaken to
correct some particularly blatant errors, mainly foreign or classical
words embedded in English text. CLAWS is not very successful at
detecting these foreign words and tagging them with their appropriate
tag (UNC), except when they form part of established expressions such
as <i>ad hoc</i> or <i>nom de plume</i> - in which case they are
normally given tags appropriate to their grammatical function, e.g. as
nouns or adverbs.  </p>
<p><span id="id2341276"></span> The main purpose of the <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#errorRates" title="POS-tagging Error Rates">report on estimated error rates</a> is to
document the rather small percentage of ambiguities and errors
remaining in the tagged BNC, so that users of the corpus can assess
the accuracy of the tagging for their own purposes. Since not
surprisingly we have been unable to inspect each of the 100 million
tags in the BNC, we have had to estimate ambiguity rates and error
rates on the basis of a manual post-editing of a corpus sample of
50,000 words. The estimate is based on twenty-four 2,000-word text
extracts and two 1,000-word extracts, selected so as to be as far as
possible representative of the whole corpus. </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv1" id="tokenization">
<h3>6.2  Tokenization: splitting the text into words</h3>
<p><span id="id2341311"></span>Regarding the segmentation of a text into individual word-tokens
 (called tokenization), our tagging practice in general follows the
 default assumption that an orthographic word (separated by spaces from adjacent words,
 with or without punctuation) is the appropriate
 unit for wordclass tagging. There are, however, exceptions to
 this. For example, a single orthographic word may consist of more
 than one grammatical word: in the case of enclitic verb contractions
 (as in <i>she&#8217;s, they&#8217;ll, we&#8217;re</i>) and negative contractions (as
 in <i>don&#8217;t, isn&#8217;t, won&#8217;t</i>), it is appropriate to assign two
 diferent wordclass tags to the same orthographic word.  A full list
 of such contracted forms recognized by CLAWS and preserved in the XML
 markup is given in section <a class="link_ptr" href="codes.html#defrobs" title="Contracted forms and multiwords">9.7  Contracted forms and multiwords</a>.
 </p>
<p><span id="id2356420"></span>Also quite frequent is the opposite circumstance, where two or more
orthographic words are given a single wordclass tag: e.g. multiword
adverbs such as <i>of course</i> and <i>in short</i>, and
multiword prepositions such as <i>instead of</i> and <i>up to</i>
are each assigned a single word tag (<tt>AV0</tt> for adverbs,
<tt>PRP</tt> for prepositions). Sometimes, whether such
orthographic sequences are to be treated as a single word for tagging
purposes depends on the context and its interpretation. <i>In
short</i> is in some circumstances not an adverb but a sequence of
preposition + adjective (eg. <i>in short sharp bursts</i> ). <i>Up
to</i> in some contexts needs to be treated as a sequence of two
grammatical words: adverbial-particle +
preposition-or-infinitive-marker (eg. <i>We had to phone her up to
get the code.</i>). </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2356488"></span>In the BNC XML edition, these multiword
units are marked using an additional XML element (<code>&lt;mw&gt;</code>) which
carries the wordclass assigned to the whole sequence. Within the
<code>&lt;mw&gt;</code> element, the individual orthographic words are also
marked, using the <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> element in the same way as elsewhere. For
example, the multiword unit <i>of course</i> is marked up as
follows: 

<div class="pre_eg">&lt;mw c5="AV0"&gt; 
  &lt;w c5="PRF" hw="of" pos="PREP"&gt;of &lt;/w&gt; 
  &lt;w c5="NN1" hw="course" pos="SUBST"&gt;course &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;/mw&gt;</div>. Wordclass tags for the constituent tags of multiword
units were automatically inserted using the table reproduced in <a class="link_ptr" href="codes.html#defrobs" title="Contracted forms and multiwords">9.7  Contracted forms and multiwords</a>; there may therefore be residual
errors in their usage.</div>
<p><span id="id2356528"></span> In one respect, we have allowed the orthographic occurrence of
 spaces to be criterial. This is in the tagging of compound words such
 as <i>markup, mark-up</i> and <i>mark up</i>. Since English
 orthographic practice is often variable in such matters, the same
 &#8216;compound&#8217; expression may occur in the corpus tagged as two words (if
 they are separated by spaces) or as one word (if the sequence is
 printed solid or with a hyphen). Thus <i>mark up</i> (as a noun)
 will be tagged <tt>NN1 AVP</tt>, whereas <i>markup</i> or
 <i>mark-up</i> will be tagged simply <tt>NN1</tt>. </p>

<div class="teidiv1" id="guide">
<h3>6.3  Tagging Guidelines and Borderline
 Cases</h3>
<p><span id="id2356590"></span>Many detailed decisions have to be made in deciding
 how to draw the line between the correct and the incorrect assignment
 of a tag. So that the concept of what is a &#8216;correct&#8217; or &#8216;accurate&#8217;
 annotation can be determined, there have to be detailed guidelines of
 tagging practice. These are constitute the <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#guidelines" title="Guidelines to the Wordclass Tagging">Wordclass Tagging Guidelines</a>. </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2356609"></span>The
 Guidelines have to give much attention to borderline phenomena, where
 the distinction between (say) an adjective and a verb participle in
 -ing is unclear, and to clarify criteria for differentiating them.
 To promote consistency of tagging practice, the guidelines may even
 impose somewhat arbitrary dividing lines between one word class and
 another. Consider the case of a word such as <i>setting</i>, which may be a
 present participle form of a verb(<tt>VVG</tt>), an adjective (<tt>AJ0</tt>) or a singular
 common noun (<tt>NN1</tt>). The difference may be illustrated by the three
 examples:
 <ul>
<li>
 Oil prices are <i>rising</i> again. (verb, <tt>VVG</tt>)</li>
<li>
 the <i>rising</i> sun (adjective, <tt>AJ0</tt>)</li>
<li>
 the attempted <i>rising</i> was put down (noun, <tt>NN1</tt>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2356679"></span> The assignment of an example of &#8216;Verb+ing&#8217; to the adjective
category relies heavily on a semantic criterion, viz.  the ability to
paraphrase Verb+ing Noun by &#8216;Noun + Relative Clause that/which/who be
Verb+ing&#8217; or &#8216;that/which/who Verb(s)&#8217; (e.g. <i>the
rising sun</i> = the sun which is/was rising; <i>a
working mother</i> = a mother who works). These contrast with a case
such as <i>dining table</i>, where the first word <i>dining</i> is judged to be a noun. The reason for this
is that the paraphrasable meaning of the expression is not &#8216;a table
which is/was dining or dines&#8217;, but rather &#8216;a table (used) for
dining&#8217;. Although somewhat arbitrary, this relative clause test is
well established in English grammatical literature, and such criteria
are useful in enabling a reasonable degree of consistency in tagging
practice to be achieved, so that the success rate of corpus tagging
can be checked and evaluated. (See further <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#m3adj-nn" title="Adjective vs. noun"> Adjective vs. noun</a>)
 </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2356735"></span>
 It also has to be recognized that some borderline cases may
 occasionally have to be considered unresolvable. We may conclude, for
 example, that the word <i>Hatching</i> (occurring as
 a heading on its own, without any syntactic context) could be equally
 well analysed <tt>VVG</tt> or <tt>NN1</tt>, and in such a case one would
 be tempted to leave the ambiguity (<tt>VVG-NN1</tt>) in the
 corpus, showing uncertainty where any grammarian would be likely to
 acknowledge it. However, in our calculations of ambiguity, we have
 adhered to the common assumption that ideally, all tags should be
 correctly disambiguated. Other examples of unresolvability from the
 sample texts are:
 <ul>
<li>
 the importance of <i>weaving</i> in the East (verb or noun? - <tt>VVG-NN1</tt>)</li>
<li>
<i>Armed</i> with the knowledge (past participle verb or adjective? - <tt>VVN-AJ0</tt>)</li>
<li>the <i>Lord</i> is my shepherd (common noun or proper noun? - <tt>NN1-NP0</tt>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2356807"></span>
 In practice, in our post-edited sample, we chose the first tag to be correct in these cases. </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv1" id="ambiguity">
<h3>6.4  Ambiguity tags, and the principle of asymmetry</h3>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2356821"></span>As in the first version of the BNC, we have introduced only a limited number of ambiguity tags, to deal with 
  particular cases where the tagger has difficulty in distinguishing two categories, and where incorrect taggings 
  would otherwise result rather frequently. Ambiguity tags involve only the following 18 wordclass labels, and each of the ambiguity tags allows only two labels to be named:
 <ul>
<li>
<tt>AJ0</tt> general adjective (positive)</li>
<li>
<tt>AV0</tt> general adverb</li>
<li>
<tt>AVP</tt> adverbial particle 	</li>
<li>
<tt>AVQ</tt> wh- adverb</li>
<li>
<tt>CJS</tt> general subordinator</li>
<li>
<tt>CJT</tt> subordinator: that 	</li>
<li>
<tt>CRD</tt> cardinal numeral </li>
<li>
<tt>DT0</tt> determiner-pronoun</li>
<li>
<tt>NN1</tt> singular common noun</li>
<li>
<tt>NN2</tt> plural common noun	</li>
<li>
<tt>NP0</tt> proper noun	</li>
<li>
<tt>PNI</tt> indefinite pronoun</li>
<li>
<tt>PRP</tt> general preposition</li>
<li>
<tt>VVB</tt> lexical verb: finite base form</li>
<li>
<tt>VVD</tt> lexical verb: past tense;</li>
<li>
<tt>VVG</tt> lexical verb: present participle (-ing form)</li>
<li>
<tt>VVN</tt> lexical verb: past participle</li>
<li>
<tt>VVZ</tt> lexical verb: -s form</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2356939"></span>
 The permitted ambiguity tags are listed in the Wordclass tagging
 guidelines (<a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#pm" title="Ambiguity Tag list"> Ambiguity Tag list</a>).  </p>
<p><span id="id2356949"></span> It will be noted that overall 30 ambiguity tags are recognized. We
also observe that each ambiguity tag (eg <tt>VVD-VVN</tt>) is
matched by another ambiguity tag which is its mirror image (eg
<tt>VVN-VVD</tt>). The ordering of tags is significant: it is the
first of the two tags which is estimated by the tagger to be the more
likely. Hence the interpretation of an ambiguity tag X-Y may be
expressed as follows: &#8216;There is not sufficient confidence to choose
between tags X and Y; however, X is considered to be more likely.&#8217;</p>

<div class="teidiv3" id="m1token">
<h5>6.5.1.2  Appearance of wordclass tags and citations</h5>
<p><span id="id2359178"></span> Throughout this section, we show text examples in a simplified format
 which is different from the XML contained in the corpus but which
 will highlight the particular tag that is being discussed.  The XML
 tagging (used to mark, for example, paragraph and pause markers) is
 not relevant to the present discussion and will usually
not be displayed in the output from software such as concordance
generators or search engines. </p>
<p><span id="id2359189"></span>As was noted above, each word in the corpus is marked by an XML
 <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> element which provides three additional pieces of
 information the wordclass, carried by the <strong>c5</strong>
 attribute, a headword or lemma derived from the word, carried by the
 <strong>hw</strong> attribute, and a simplified wordclass derived from
 the c5 value, carried by the <strong>pos</strong> attribute. </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359211"></span>In the XML source therefore, we will see sentences like this:

<div class="pre_eg">&lt;w c5="AV0" hw="apparently" pos="ADV"&gt;apparently &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="PNP" hw="we" pos="PRON"&gt;we &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="VVB" hw="eat" pos="VERB"&gt;eat &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="DT0" hw="more" pos="ADJ"&gt;more &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="NN1" hw="chocolate" pos="SUBST"&gt;chocolate &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="CJS" hw="than" pos="CONJ"&gt;than &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="DT0" hw="any" pos="ADJ"&gt;any &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="AJ0" hw="other" pos="ADJ"&gt;other &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;w c5="NN1" hw="country" pos="SUBST"&gt;country&lt;/w&gt;
&lt;c c5="PUN"&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</div> 

For simplicity of discussion throughout this section we have chosen
not to present examples in this way, but instead to suppress the bulk
of the XML markup. Only the wordclass attribute of the word (or
words) being in question, we have preserved this and placed it
<em>after</em> the word it relates to in the example
sentences. Under <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#m2conj" title="Conjunctions">subordinating
conjunctions</a>, for instance, the citation above appears as
follows: 
<blockquote class="display"><p> ...apparently we eat more chocolate than_CJS any other country. [G3U.1000]</p></blockquote> 
This is purely as an aid to
reading the present document; in the corpus itself, all wordclass
tagging is represented using the XML conventions shown above. </div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359253"></span>As noted above, any example from the BNC can be identified by means
of the text identifier (a three character code such as GRU) and the
number of the <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> element within it. We use this method
throughout the following examples, where they are taken from the BNC.
Thus, the example above is taken from s-unit 1000 of text G3U. In 
sections <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#m3" title="Disambiguation Guide">6.5.9  Disambiguation Guide</a> and <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#m4" title="Disambiguation by Word">6.5.9.2  Disambiguation by Word</a> below, we
occasionally cite cases where the POS-tagging in the corpus does not
match the tag given in the citation, in that it is either an error or
an ambiguity tag. This is to give an idea of the contexts in which the
resolution of ambiguities has been less reliable. We list the tag
found in the corpus next to the file reference with an asterisk,
eg. in <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#m4well" title="WELL">well</a> we give the ideal tag as
<tt>VVB</tt>, but the actual tag as <tt>AV0</tt>: <blockquote class="display"><p>
Tears well_VVB up in my eyes.[BN3.5 *AV0] </p></blockquote>

 Note also that we occasionally use invented examples, rather than
 corpus citations, especially where a contrast between categories is
 being made. </div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="contracted">
<h6> Appearance and tagging of contracted forms</h6>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359313"></span>Contracted forms &#8212; including enclitics, eg <i>he's</i>, <i>she'll</i>,
 negatives eg <i>don't</i> and <i>can't</i>, and 'fused words', eg
 <i>wanna</i> and <i>gimme</i> &#8212; are broken down by the tagger into their
 component parts, with each part being assigned its own tags. No spaces are introduced in
 POS-tagged contracted words: <blockquote class="display"><p>doesn't = does_VDZ n't_XX0<br>
dunno = Du_VDB n_XX0 no_VVI<br>
wanna = wan_VVB na_TO0 or wan_VVB na_AT0<br>
gimme = Gim_VVB me_PNP   </p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2359372"></span>This procedure sometimes results in strange-looking word
  divisions, particularly with the fused words. However, they do
  provide a ready means of comparison with the full forms, such as
  <i>want_VVB to_TO0</i> and <i>give_VVB me_PNP.</i></p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359391"></span>Note that in the case of <i>ain't</i> it has been tricky to
 resolve the tag of the first part ( <i>ai </i>)
 satisfactorily. Therefore in all contexts we have tagged this as an
 unclassified word, followed by the negative particle. <blockquote class="display"><p> 
 Ai_UNC n't_XX0 got yours yet [KCT.1281]</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="multiwords">
<h6> Appearance and tagging of multiwords</h6>
<p><span id="id2359427"></span>The term `multiwords' denotes multiple-word combinations to which
 CLAWS assigns a single wordclass tag - for example, a complex
 preposition, an adverbial, or a foreign expression naturalised into
 English as a compound noun. In the XML version of the corpus, these
 sequences are explicitly marked using an XML element
 (<code>&lt;mw&gt;</code>). The individual orthographic words of which the
 sequence is composed are also marked, in the same way as other words,
 using the <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> element. </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359444"></span>For example, as noted above, in the XML source of the corpus, the multiword
sequence <i>of course</i> is tagged as follows:
<blockquote class="display"><p>&lt;mw c5="AV0"&gt;  
  &lt;w c5="PRF" lemma="of" pos="PREP"&gt;of &lt;/w&gt;
  &lt;w c5="NN1" lemma="course" pos="SUBST"&gt;course &lt;/w&gt;
&lt;/mw&gt;</p></blockquote>
When displaying examples which contain multiwords in this chapter, we
display only the wordclass of the outermost <code>&lt;mw&gt;</code> element. Its
boundaries are indicated, where possible, by extra highlighting:
<blockquote class="display"><p><em>Of course_AV0</em> I can.  [H9V.212]</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2359480"></span>The wordclass tags assigned to constituent parts of multiword items
are listed in <a class="link_ptr" href="codes.html#defrobs" title="Contracted forms and multiwords">9.7  Contracted forms and multiwords</a>. This part of the wordclass
tagging was done automatically during the XML conversion process, and
has not been checked by CLAWS. </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359491"></span>Note that some multiwords can represent different categories
 according to context, e.g.  <i>in between</i> in: <blockquote class="display"><p> The
 stage <em>in between_PRP</em> the original negative and the dupe
 is called an interpositive [FB8.295] <br> The truth lies somewhere
 <em>in between_AV0</em> [ABK.2834] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359518"></span>Moreover, sometimes it is more appropriate to tag a word
 combination as consisting of ordinary words than as a multiword
 sequence, as in the case of <i>but for</i> below: <blockquote class="display"><p><br>
 but_CJC for_PRP years now darkness has been growing [F99.2027]
 cf. <br> which they would not have done <em>but
 for_PRP</em> the presence of the police. [H81.766]

<div class="teidiv4" id="slash">
<h6> Words joined by the slash character </h6>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2359555"></span>Words which are joined together by a slash ( / ) but no whitespace, such as
 <i>and/or</i>, are not split up in tagged versions of the text. 
 
<ul>
<li>if they are of the same wordclass they are assigned the same tag;</li>

<h4>6.5.4  Articles, determiners &amp; pronouns</h4>
<p><span id="id2361131"></span>Articles, definite or indefinite, are tagged
 <tt>AT0</tt>. Pronouns which act as determiners of various kinds
 (all, which, your etc.) are given tags <tt>DPS</tt>,
 <tt>DT0</tt>, or <tt>DTQ</tt>, and distinguished from
pronouns which do not have a determiner function. These are marked
using one of the tags <tt>PNP</tt>, <tt>PNI</tt>,
<tt>PNQ</tt>, or <tt>PNX</tt> depending on their function.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Articles</dt>
<dd>All articles are tagged <tt>AT0</tt>. An article is  defined
here as a determiner word which typically begins a noun phrase, but
which cannot occur as the head of a noun phrase. 
 Examples include <i>a/an</i>, <i>the</i>, <i>no</i> and
 <i>every</i>:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  Have a_AT0 break<br> Every_AT0 year<br>There's no_AT0
time</p></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Determiners</dt>
<dd>Recognising that there is a high degree of formal and functional overlap between determiners and pronouns, we have conflated under the D-- heading
 words that are capable of either function. We distinguish three classes of determiner pronouns:
<dl>
<dt>Determiner-Pronoun</dt>
<dd>Words such as <i>few</i>, <i>both</i>, <i>another</i> are

<dt>Interrogative determiner-pronoun</dt>
<dd>The  wh- (interrogative) determiner-pronoun is tagged <tt>DTQ</tt>. <i>Which</i> and <i>what </i> are always tagged <tt>DTQ</tt>:
 <blockquote class="display"><p> Which_DTQ country do you live in? [A7N.979]<br> And she

 personal (<tt>PNP</tt>), eg <i>I</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>they</i>, <i>us</i>. Note also: <i>it</i> is included here.
 </li>

<tt>ZZ0</tt> is used for a free-standing letter of the

 clearly represents a separate word, or an abbreviation of a separate
 word, we have tried to assign the appropriate POS-tag for the full

<h4>6.5.9  Disambiguation Guide</h4>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362480"></span>The following is a guide to resolution of the most common tagging
 ambiguities. It states the principles by which we have drawn the line
 between the "correct" and the "incorrect" assignment of a tag in
 particular contexts (as applied in the <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#errorRates" title="POS-tagging Error Rates">report on tagging error rates</a>.) Note that
 in the next two sections, we also cite examples where the POS-tagging
 in the corpus is less reliable and does not match that given for the
 citation. In such cases we append the actual tag in the corpus to the
 file reference with an asterisk. Eg. under Adjective vs Adverb (next
 section), the preferred tag for <i>long</i> is <tt>AV0</tt>, but the actual
 tag is ambiguous <tt>AV0-AJ0</tt>: <blockquote class="display"><p> You're not supposed to keep
 medicine that long_AV0. [H8Y.1976 *AV0-AJ0] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2362518"></span>Note also that in this section we use a number of invented
 examples (in addition to corpus citations) to clarify the distinction
 between categories.

<h5>6.5.9.1  Disambiguation by Tag Pair</h5>
<div class="teidiv4" id="m3adj-adv">
<h6> Adjective vs. adverb</h6>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362542"></span>
 After a verb or an object, there is sometimes a difficult choice
 between <tt>AJ0</tt> and <tt>AV0</tt>, or between <tt>AJC</tt> and <tt>AV0</tt>. e.g.:<blockquote class="display"><p> 
 We arrived tired_AJ0, but safe_AJ0 [CCP.529] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362565"></span> Here, both <i>tired </i>and <i>safe</i> are AJ0. The main test is to see whether one can express the relation between these words
 and their logical subjects using the verb <i>be: They arrived tired but safe</i> implies 'They were tired but safe'. The
 word tagged <tt>AJ0</tt> refers to a property of a noun, rather than to a
 property of an event or situation. Contrast:
<blockquote class="display"><p> After a little he remembered it and sang out loud_AV0.[A0N.1144]--&gt;  </p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2362601"></span>
 This sentence does not imply that he <em>was</em> loud,
 but is more or less equivalent to <i>He sang out loudly</i>. It means that his <em>singing</em> was loud.
 </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362618"></span>
 It follows that when, in colloquial English, a word which we normally
 expect to be an adjective is used as an adverb, we should tag it <tt>AV0</tt>:
 <blockquote class="display"><p> You did great_AV0 though. [HH0.3248 *AV0-AJ0] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362633"></span> Here is another pair of examples, where the <tt>AJ0/AV0</tt> word follows
 an object:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  everyone below 25 grew their hair too long_AJ0.  [ARP.590 *AV0-AJ0]<br> (i.e. 'their hair was too long'.) <br>
  Try not to keep her too long_AV0. [FAB.3620 *AV0-AJ0] <br> (i.e. NOT 'she will be too long.') 
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362668"></span> Also note the similar distinction between <tt>AJC</tt> and <tt>AV0</tt>:<blockquote class="display"><p>
 They'll have to make the taxes higher_AJC.  ('the taxes will be higher') <br>
  We can make this piece higher_AJC if you want to. [BNG.2268]<br>  
  You'll have to aim higher_AV0. (NOT 'you will be higher') <br>
  You should aim higher_AV0 [ACN.984 *AJC] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362697"></span>Similar considerations arise for the choice between <tt>AJS</tt> and <tt>AV0</tt>:
<blockquote class="display"><p> I thought it best_AJS to call. [AT4.3239] <br>
I liked the cartoons best_AV0 [CAM.194]</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="m3adj-nn">
<h6> Adjective vs. noun</h6>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362726"></span>There are many words in English which can be tagged either
 adjective (<tt>AJ0</tt>) or noun (<tt>NN1</tt>). Colour words like <i>black, white
 </i>and <i>red</i> are fairly consistent in allowing the two tags,
 and may be used to illustrate the difference. In attributive
 (premodifying) or predicative (complementing) positions without
 further modification these words are normally adjectives: 
<blockquote class="display"><p>a  white_AJ0 screen, The screen is white_AJ0. </p></blockquote>
When the word is the  head of a noun phrase, on the other hand, it is a noun:
 <blockquote class="display"><p>Red_NN1 is my favourite colour. <br>They painted the wall
 a brilliant white_NN1.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362770"></span> Sometimes a word cannot be used predicatively as an adjective,
 but can occur attributively in a way which suggests adjectival
 use. For example, <i>past</i> and <i>present</i> are
 adjectives in <blockquote class="display"><p>
 All past_AJ0 and present_AJ0 employees of the branch are invited. [K99.216] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362794"></span> We do not find <i>present</i> or similar words being used as predicative
 adjectives, however: <blockquote class="display"><p> 
 *These needs are past, present, and future.
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2362809"></span> (Note that <i>present</i> can be used as a predicative adjective
 meaning the opposite of <i>absent</i>; but this meaning is not comparable
 to the temporal meanings of <i>past, present</i> and <i>future</i>
 above.)</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362838"></span>
 Contrast K99.216 above with cases where <i>past, present</i> etc.
 are heads of noun phrases, e.g. following the definite article,
 and are clearly nouns:
<blockquote class="display"><p> You're living in the past_NN1. [HGS.1045] <br>I don't even want to think about the future_NN1. [JY4.2864] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2362858"></span>
 The only reason for treating <i>past</i> and <i>present</i> in
 the example above as adjectives is that they have an institutionalized
 meaning as modifiers, which is rather different from the meaning
 they have as nouns. Further examples of this type are words such
 as <i>model</i> in <i>model behaviour, giant</i> in <i>a giant
 caterpillar</i> and <i>vintage</i> in <i>vintage cars</i>. 
 </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362907"></span> Words ending in <i>-ing</i> are a particular problem: when they
 premodify a noun, they can be tagged either <tt>NN1</tt> (noun) or <tt>AJ0</tt> (adjective).
 Contrast:
<blockquote class="display"><p>     new spending_NN1 plans [CEN.5922]<br> a working_AJ0 mother [ED4.153]  <br>
   his reading_NN1 ability [CFV.1897]  <br>in the coming_AJ0 weeks [HKU.1333] 
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362939"></span> The guideline is as follows.
 If <i>X-ing + Noun</i> is equivalent in meaning to <i>Noun
 who/which X-es</i> (or <i>X-ed</i> or  <i>BE + X-ing</i>), then <i>X-ing</i> is an adjective (<tt>AJ0</tt>).
 That is, a word ending <i>-ing</i> is an adjective when it is the
 notional subject of the noun it premodifies. For example:
<blockquote class="display"><p> 
 two smiling_AJ0 children [HTT.743]  ('two children who are smiling')   </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2362990"></span>
 In other cases, <i>X-ing</i> is generally a noun (<tt>NN1</tt>). In such cases, it is often possible to paraphrase <i>X-ing + Noun</i> 
 by a more explicit phrase in which <i>X-ing</i> is clearly a noun:
 <blockquote class="display"><p> new spending_NN1 plans ('new plans for spending')<br> his reading_NN1 ability ('his ability in reading')  </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363024"></span>
 Further examples:<blockquote class="display"><p> 
 a mating_AJ0 animal [GU8.2142]<br> the mating_NN1 game [ECG.336 *AJ0-NN1] <br> a falling_AJ0 rate of unemployment [KR2.2129] <br>slimming_NN1 tablets. [KCA.941 *NN1-VVG]  </p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="m3rrr-dar">
<h6> Determiner-pronoun vs. adverb</h6>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363052"></span><i>More</i> and <i>less</i> can be assigned to either of the tags
 <tt>DT0</tt> or <tt>AV0</tt>. The difference between them is that <tt>DT0</tt> is for noun-phrase-like
 (and determiner-like) uses of the word in question, whereas <tt>AV0</tt>
 is for adverbial uses. The two can be hard to distinguish, particularly
 after a verb:
 <blockquote class="display"><p> (a) You should relax more_AV0. <br> (b) You should spend more_DT0.
 
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363091"></span> Since <i>relax</i> is an intransitive verb in (a), <i>more</i>
 cannot be a noun phrase following it. Instead, <i>more</i> can
 be paraphrased roughly as 'to a greater extent' or 'to a greater
 degree'. On the other hand, <i>spend</i> in (b) is a transitive
 verb, and so <i>more</i> is a determiner-pronoun form following
 it. As confirmation of this, note that sentence (b) could be turned
 into a passive with <i>more</i> as subject: <i>More should be
 spent...</i>. There are unfortunately some verbs for which the
 distinction is less clear than in the above examples, e.g.:<blockquote class="display"><p>
  You should eat more. <br>You should read more. <br>You should smoke less.
 
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363154"></span>
 In these cases, the verb may be used transitively or intransitively
 with almost identical meanings, so that the syntactic structures
 of the immediate and/or surrounding context are the only clues
 as to which is the case:
 <blockquote class="display"><p>Do you smoke? (Intransitive)<br>How many do you smoke in a week? (Transitive)
  </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363169"></span>
 Contrast (c) and (d) below:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  (c) <i>At the moment we have 23 fixtures per season. Personally, I would rather play more_DT0.</i><br> (d) <i>You should work less and play more_AV0.</i></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2363193"></span>
 (In (d) the adverb <i>more</i> has roughly the meaning of 'more
 often'.)</p>
<p><span id="id2363204"></span>
 Note. The automatic disambiguation of determiners and adverbs is not reliable, because transitivity has not been encoded in the tagger. Sentences like (c) and (d), where <i>more</i> follows the verb at end of a sentence, are invariably tagged <tt>AV0</tt>.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="m3adj-part">
<h6> Adjective vs. participle </h6>
<p><span id="id2363234"></span>
 Another area of borderline cases is the tagging of words as adjectives
 (<tt>AJ0</tt>) or as participles (<tt>VVG</tt> or
 <tt>VVN</tt>).</p>
<p><span id="id2363248"></span>One test is to see whether a degree adverb like <i>very</i> can be inserted in front of the
 word: e.g. in <i>We were very surprised</i>, <i>surprised</i> is an <tt>AJ0</tt>.
</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363274"></span> Another test, having the opposite effect, is to see
 whether there is an agent <i>by</i>-phrase following the word in
 <i>-ed</i> or <i>-en</i>. If so it is a <tt>VVN</tt>: <blockquote class="display"><p>We were
 surprised_VVN by pirates.</p></blockquote> Even where it is not present, the
 possibility of adding the <i>by-</i>phrase, without changing the
 meaning of the word, is evidence in favour of <tt>VVN</tt>. (However, this
 criterion can clash with the preceding one &#8212; since it occasionally
 happens that an <i>-ed</i> word is both preceded by an adverb like
 <i>very</i> and followed by a <i>by-</i>phrase: E.g. <i>I was so
 irritated by his behaviour that I put the phone down.</i> When these
 do occur, we give preference to <tt>AJ0</tt>.)
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363349"></span>A third test is negative: to see whether the word in question
 can be placed before a noun. e.g.: 
<blockquote class="display"><p> 
  The effect is lasting_AJ0 (compare a lasting_AJ0 effect).<br>
  The door is locked_AJ0 (compare the locked_AJ0 door.)<br></p></blockquote>
 This shows that <i>lasting</i> or <i>locked</i> can easily be (but need not be) an <tt>AJ0</tt>. If the word could not be placed (with
 the same meaning) before the noun, this would be evidence that the word is a participle.</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363384"></span>Even though an <i>-ing</i> word is normally a <tt>VVG</tt> after
 the verb <i>be</i>, it is generally treated as an <tt>AJ0</tt> before a noun:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  The man was dying_VVG. [HTM.1494 *VVG-AJ0]<br>
  the dying_AJ0 man. [FSF.1787] </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363415"></span> However, when the <i>-ing</i> or <i>-ed</i> forms part of
 a premodifying phrase, the <tt>VVG</tt> or <tt>VVN</tt> tag is preferred:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  an interest_NN1 earning_VVG account<br> a hypothesis_NN1 driven_VVN approach  
</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2363446"></span>
 In these examples the <tt>NN1+VVG/VVN</tt> sequence has the character of a premodifying adjective compound. We can therefore imagine the
 two words bracketed together forming an adjective: <i>an interest-earning_AJ0 account</i>. But within the adjective, the <tt>VVG</tt> and <tt>VVN</tt> tags retain their verbal character, with the initial noun acting as object of the verb (cf. <i>the account earns interest</i>).
 </p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363476"></span>
 The same applies when the premodifying compound phase is noun-like:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  a shanty_NN1 singing_VVG competition[K4W.2952]  </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363487"></span> If the verb <i>be</i> can be replaced by another verb such
 as <i>seem</i> or <i>become</i>, without changing the meaning
 of the following <tt>AJ0 / VVN</tt> word, this is a strong indication that
 the construction is not properly a passive, and that the word
 is an <tt>AJ0</tt>:<blockquote class="display"><p><i>The building was infested_AJ0 with cockroaches</i><br> (cf.: <i>The building seemed/became infested with cockroaches</i>)  
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363542"></span> A further distinction which can be used to test with 'event' verbs is that the AJ0 refers to a 'resultant state', whereas the
 VVN refers to an event:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  Bill was married_AJ0. (i.e. he was not single) <br>
  Bill was married_VVN to Sarah on the 15th May. (i.e. the actual event)  </p></blockquote>

 This is a manifestation of the general semantic character of adjectives
 (which typically refer to states or qualities) and verbs (which
 typically refer to events or actions).</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363561"></span>
 However, this criterion is not definitive, as <tt>VVG</tt> and <tt>VVN</tt> can also sometimes refer to states, when the meaning of the verb is stative: 
<blockquote class="display"><p> She is not disturbed_VVN by that sort of threat.<br> The tourists were standing_VVG around a map of the city.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363581"></span> Finally, here is a test which clearly identifies an <i>-ing</i> form as a verb.
 A verb takes following complements such as a noun phrase, an adjective or an adverbial. These cannot follow the same word as adjective. E.g.:
<blockquote class="display"><p> Are you expecting_VVG someone?[G01.2610]<br> 
  The arithmetic is looking_VVG good. [K1M.3611] <br> 
  Turning_VVG suddenly, she ran for the safety of the car [CK8.297] 
 </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363606"></span> Contrast:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  His manner was insulting_AJ0.  </p></blockquote>
 where <i>insulting</i> could not normally be followed by an object:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  * insulting us. </p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="m3prep-avp">
<h6> Preposition vs. prepositional adverb vs. general adverb</h6>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363644"></span>
 This kind of ambiguity occurs frequently, particularly in spoken texts. Compare:
<blockquote class="display"><p> (a) She ran down_PRP the hill.
<br>(b) She ran down_AVP her best friends. </p></blockquote>

 In (a), <i>down</i> is a preposition, because: <ul>
<li> An adverb could be inserted before it:
<blockquote class="display"><p> She ran quickly down the hill.<br>(But not: *She ran viciously down her best friends.) </p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>It can be moved (somewhat awkwardly) to the front of a <i>wh</i>-word:
<blockquote class="display"><p> This is the hill down_PRP which he ran.<br> Down_PRP which slopes do you like ski-ing? </p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363702"></span>
 In (b), <i>down</i> is an adverbial particle because:
 <ul>
<li>It can be placed before or after the noun phrase acting as
 object of the verb:<blockquote class="display"><p><br>
 She ran her best friends down_AVP.<br> (But not: *She ran the hill down.)
 </p></blockquote>
</li>
<li> If the noun phrase is replaced by a pronoun, the pronoun has
 to be placed in front of the particle:
 <blockquote class="display"><p>She ran them down_AVP. (= her best friends)<br>(But not: *She ran down them.)<br></p></blockquote>
 Similarly: <blockquote class="display"><p>The dentist took all my teeth out_AVP. (The dentist took them out)
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2363755"></span>
 Notice that the syntactic distinction between (for example) <i>down</i> as an adverbial particle and <i>down</i>  as a preposition
 is independent of the semantic distinction between locative and
 non-locative interpretations of <i>down</i>.</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363779"></span>
 When the verb is simply followed by <i>down</i> or <i>out</i>,
 etc., without a following noun phrase, it is normally an <tt>AVP</tt>:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  Income tax is coming down_AVP.<br> 
   The decorations are put up_AVP on Christmas Eve. </p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2363807"></span>
 However, it is important to recognize 'stranded' prepositions,
 which have been deprived of the company of their noun phrase,
 the prepositional complement, because it has been fronted or omitted
 through ellipsis (e.g. in relative clauses, with passives, in
 questions, etc.):
<blockquote class="display"><p> This is the hill (which) she ran down_PRP.<br>(Cf. This is the hill down which she ran.)
  <br>The poor were looked down on_PRP by the rich.<br>(Here <i>on</i> is the stranded preposition)
 <br>Which car did she arrive in_PRP? </p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><span id="id2363837"></span>
 The same tests apply to words which are tagged either as prepositions or as general adverbs (AV0), such as <i>across, past</i> and <i>behind</i>.

<p><span id="id2363970"></span>The contraction <i>ain't</i> is a special case: its first half

<dt>Contracted forms</dt>
<dd>
 When it represents a shortened form of <i>is</i>, <i>has</i> or (rarely) <i>does</i>, it has the appropriate verb tag. 
 Occasionally, for example with auxiliaries followed by past participles, there are difficulties determining what the full form of the verb should be.
 Examples:

<dd>When <i>'s</i> acts as a marker of the -<i>s</i> plural, or as part

<h6> AS</h6>
<dl>
<dt>Comparative constructions:</dt>
<dd>
<i>As</i> is a degree adverb (AV0) when it occurs before an adjective,
 adverb or determiner (and sometimes other words) in phrases of
 the type <i>as X as Y,</i> or simply <i>as X</i> (where the comparative
 clause or phrase <i>as Y</i>) is omitted but understood:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  I go to see them as_AV0 often as I can .  [AC7.1189]<br>
 and they employ ninety people, twice as_AV0 many as last year.  [K1C.3540]<br>
And every bit as_AV0 good .[EEW.1132 *CJS]
  </p></blockquote>
 In the first and second examples above, the second <i>as</i> introduces
 a comparative construction which expresses 'equal comparison',
 as contrasted with the unequal comparison of <i>more X than Y</i>.
 When <i>as</i> is a word introducing such a comparative construction,
 it is tagged <tt>CJS</tt>:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  Capitalism is not as_AV0 good as_CJS it claims. [CFT.2042]<br>
 Linked together, they can crunch numbers as_AV0 fast as_CJS any mainframe.[CRB.271]<br>
 She will deposit as_AV0 many as_CJS a dozen eggs there. [F9F.424]<br></p></blockquote>
 Notice that <i>as</i> in this comparative use is tagged CJS whether
 or not it introduces a clause. Often it introduces a noun phrase.
 In the following example, it introduces an adjective:<br><blockquote class="display"><p>  always reply as_AV0 quickly as_CJS possible. [C9R.989]
 </p></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Introducing other clauses:</dt>
<dd>
 The tag CJS is also used when introducing other subordinate clauses,
 such as adverbial clauses of time or reason:
<blockquote class="display"><p>
 New York called just as_CJS I was leaving.  [APU.1543]<br>
 As_CJS you've gone to so much trouble , it would seem discourteous to refuse [KY9.2107]
 </p></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Preposition:</dt>
<dd> The tag <tt>PRP</tt> is used for <i>as</i> functioning clearly as a preposition:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  Consider it as_PRP a kind of insurance [AD0.1641]<br>
 As_PRP head of information, Christina will lead a team of four TEC staff... [BM4.2830]
 </p></blockquote>
  Usually the meaning is related to the equative meaning of the
 verb <i>be</i>. However, the guideline restricts <tt>PRP</tt> to cases
 where <i>as</i> is followed by the normal noun phrase or nominal,
 as is normal for prepositions. Where the <i>as</i> is followed
 by an adjective or a past participle clause, it is tagged <tt>CJS</tt>,
 even though it may retain the equative type of meaning:
 <blockquote class="display"><p> We regard these results as_CJS encouraging. [B1G.184]<br>
 I very much hope that you will in fact support the motion as_CJS originally intended. [KGX.93]
 </p></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Multiwords:</dt>
<dd>
<i>As</i> is part of many multiwords which get tagged with a
 single tag: e.g. <i>as soon as</i>, <i>such as, in so far as,
 as long as, as well as</i>. The sequence <i>as well as,</i> for
 example, is tagged as a preposition (<tt>PRP</tt>) in such examples as <br><blockquote class="display"><p> Sometimes <em>as well as</em>_PRP going this way we actually need to go in this was too. [G5N.31] </p></blockquote>
  Note that this is different from the multiword adverb <i>as well</i> (meaning
 <i>also</i>); it is also different from the sequence of <i>as
 well as</i> as three separate words, e.g. in:
<blockquote class="display"><p> She's as_AV0 well_AJ0 as_CJS can be expected. [F9X.2095]</p></blockquote>

</dd>
<dt>Subordinating conjunction or preposition:</dt>
<dd>
<i>But</i> is either a conjunction (<tt>CJS</tt>) or a preposition (<tt>PRP</tt>)
 if it has the meaning of 'except (for)', 'other than' or 'apart
 from'. <tt>CJS</tt> is used when it introduces a clause, and <tt>PRP</tt> is used
 when it introduces a phrase:
<blockquote class="display"><p>...mediocre albums that do nothing but_CJS take up shelf space [C9M.1014]
 <br>I couldn't help but_CJS notice. [JY0.5323 *CJC]

<dt>Coordinating conjunction:</dt>
<dd>
 Otherwise <i>but</i> is a coordinating conjunction, tagged <tt>CJC</tt>,
 linking units of the same kind (e.g. clauses or adjective/adverb
 phrases). Its function is to express contrastive or 'adversative'
 meaning:
<blockquote class="display"><p>  God and minds do exist , but_CJC materially so . [ABM.1265]<br>

<blockquote class="display"><p> 
 Many experts claim that_CJT it is good for your growing baby, too. [G2T.1091]

  and also to <i>that</i> as a relativizer (introducing a relative
 clause):
<blockquote class="display"><p> 
 A ship that_CJT never enters harbour. [BPA.1326]
 </p></blockquote>
This is different from the more traditional analysis which treats
 <i>that</i> introducing a relative clause as a relative pronoun.

<li>As a degree adverb (intensifier):
<blockquote class="display"><p>

 an adverbial clause, it is tagged <tt>CJS</tt>. Otherwise it is
 tagged <tt>AVQ</tt>.  The <tt>AVQ</tt> tag is also used for
 <i>when</i> introducing a question.  Examples:

<h4>6.5.10  Features of spoken corpus tagging</h4>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2366518"></span>The spoken and written texts of the BNC have been tagged in the same way, except that the following 
 phenomena occur almost entirely in the spoken part of the corpus.
 
 <dl>

 each being tagged <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#m2misc_zz0" title="Letter"><tt>ZZ0</tt></a>.
 <blockquote class="display"><p>children who go to the E_ZZ0 N_ZZ0 T_ZZ0 clinic [KB8.3805]<br>
 ...ten ninety minute tapes! T_ZZ0 D_ZZ0 K_ZZ0 tapes! [KPG.3534-5]
 </p></blockquote>
<p><span id="id2366554"></span>In the written corpus these items would nearly always be written
 and tagged as whole words (<i>ENT</i> or <i>TDK</i> in the above
 example).
 </p>
</dd>
<dt>Truncated words</dt>
<dd>Words that are left incomplete by the speaker are enclosed
 within an XML 
 <code>&lt;trunc&gt;</code> element and tagged <tt>UNC</tt>. Examples include <i>bathr</i> and 
 <i>su</i> in the following
 <blockquote class="display"><p><i>The <code>&lt;trunc&gt;</code> bathr_UNC <code>&lt;/trunc&gt;</code> er you can't
 beat a white bathroom suite anyway.</i> [KCF.721]<br>
  Aye, they only came in the <code>&lt;trunc&gt;</code> su_UNC <code>&lt;/trunc&gt;</code> they only came up here in the summer. [GYS.127] 
 </p></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Partial repetition of multiwords</dt>
<dd> 
 Occasionally in spoken data it happens that only a portion of a 
multiword sequence is repeated. In this example, the word <i>sort</i> is used twice; in both cases 
 it appears to function not as a separate word but as part of the multiword adverb 
 <i>sort of</i>.
<blockquote class="display"><p>  we're going to sort sort of summarize...  [G5X.106] </p></blockquote>
 
 We treat the first <i>sort</i> as an incomplete multiword, and tag it <tt>UNC</tt>
 (rather like truncated words, above). The complete multiword <i>sort of</i> is tagged <tt>AV0</tt>, as normally. 
 <blockquote class="display"><p> we're going to sort_UNC <em>sort of</em>_AV0 summarize... </p></blockquote>
  Further examples of incomplete multiwords are the <i>as long</i> in <i>as long as</i> (conjunction), <i>of</i> in <i>because of</i> (preposition) and the <i>in</i> in <i>in general</i> (adverb) below
 <blockquote class="display"><p> As_UNC long_UNC As_CJS long as everyone recognizes that for an area of that size... [J9T.258]<br>
 because_PRP of the &lt;pause&gt; of_UNC the drought. When we were away it didn't get watered in. [KCH.982]<br>
  I know that in_UNC in_UNC in_AV0 general, in in in erm, imperial measure, it is &lt;trunc&gt; f &lt;/trunc&gt; five feet eight inches [JK1.480] 
 </p></blockquote>
 
The second example shows that when words are repeated, the incomplete
portion of a multiword is not necessarily immediately adjacent to the
fully formed multiword. In the last example, the three instances of
<i>in</i> before <i>erm, imperial measure</i> have not been
analysed as part of the multiword <i>in general</i>; they are
instead tagged as ordinary words (in this case, ambiguous between
preposition and prepositional adverb: PRP-AVP). There are a few cases
where the tagger has probably been over-zealous in spotting repeated
portions of multiwords: <blockquote class="display"><p>  What happens now_UNC, now_CJS that
you are winched down? [HEF.9] </p></blockquote> Here, the first instance of
<i>now</i> would probably have better been interpreted as a single
word adverb (='at this time'), not part of the multiword conjunction
<i>now that</i><a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note5"><sup>5</sup></a>.  </dd>
<dt>
<i>Er</i> and <i>erm</i> inside multiwords</dt>
<dd>Generally (in both written and spoken texts) the pause fillers <i>er</i> 
 and <i>erm</i> take the tag <tt>UNC</tt>. This applies also
 when they appear within  a multiword 
 sequence, as in <i>every er so often</i>. The code assigned to the surrounding
 <code>&lt;mw&gt;</code> element is identical to that which would have been
 assigned if the filler were not present.
 <blockquote class="display"><p> And your homework was handed in <em>every er so often</em>_AV0, you know [G64.152]<br><br>something had gone wrong with the <code>&lt;pause&gt;</code> gas pipes <em>because erm of</em>_PRP <code>&lt;pause&gt;</code> flooding. [KB8.5356]<br><br>these kind of books were, er, generally er, at , <em>at er best</em>_AV0 ignored [HUN] </p></blockquote>
 
 Note that in the last example the word <i>at</i> preceding the multiword 
 <i>at er best</i> is treated as a partial repetition of that multiword, and 
 therefore tagged <tt>UNC</tt>.</dd>

<h3>6.6   POS-tagging Error Rates</h3>
<p><span id="id2366920"></span>This section  reports on the accuracy of the results of the improved tagging programs.</p>
<div class="teidiv2" id="body.1_div.6_div.6_div.1">
<h4>6.6.1  Levels of estimation</h4>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2366930"></span>Based on the findings from the 50,000-word test sample, the estimated ambiguity and error rates for the BNC are shown below in three different degrees of detail.:
<ul>
<li> First, as a general assessment of accuracy, the estimated
rates are given for the whole corpus. (See <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-1" title="">Table 23. Estimated ambiguity and error rates for the whole corpus (fine-grained calculation)</a> below.)</li>
<li> Secondly, separate estimates of ambiguity rates and error rates are given for each of the 57 word tags in the corpus. This will enable users of the corpus to assign appropriate degrees of reliability to each tag. Some tags are always correct; other tags are quite often erroneous. For example, the tag VDD stands for a single form of the verb do: the form did. Since the spelling did is unambiguous, the chances of ambiguity or error, in the use of the tag VDD, are virtually nil. On the other hand, the tag VVB (base finite form of a lexical verb) is not only quite frequent, but also highly prone to ambiguity and error. 15 per cent of the occurrences of VVB are errors - a much higher error rate than any other tag. (See <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-2" title="">Table 25. Estimated ambiguity rates and error
 rates by tag</a> below.)
</li>
<li> Thirdly, separate estimates of ambiguity rates and error
rates are given for &#8216;wrong-tag--right-tag&#8217; pairings XXX, YYY,
consisting of (i) the actually-occurring erroneous tag XXX, and (ii)
the correct tag YYY which should have occurred in its place. However,
because the number of possible tag-pairs is large (572), and most of
these tag-pairs have few or no errors, only the more common pairings
of erroneous tag and correct tag are separately listed, with their
estimated probability of occurrence. This list of tag-pairings will
help users further, in enabling them to estimate not merely the
reliability of a tag, but, if that tag is incorrect, the likelihood
that the correct tag would have been some other particular tag. In
this way, the frequency of grammatical word classes, or individual
words in those classes, can be estimated more accurately for the whole
BNC. (See <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-3" title="">Table 26. Estimated frequency of selected tag-pairs</a> below.)  </li>

<h4>6.6.2  Presentation of Ambiguity Rates and Error Rates (fine-grained mode of calculation)</h4>
<p><span id="id2367014"></span>In this section, we examine ambiguities and errors using a

 importance to any other error. In <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#coarse" title="Presentation of Ambiguity and Error Rates (coarse-grained calculation)">6.6.3.1  Presentation of Ambiguity and Error Rates (coarse-grained calculation)</a> we look at

 The success of an automatic tagger is sometimes represented in terms
 of the information-retrieval measures of precision and recall, rather
 than ambiguity rate and error rate as in <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-1" title="">Table 23. Estimated ambiguity and error rates for the whole corpus (fine-grained calculation)</a>. Precision is the
 extent to which incorrect tags are successfully discarded from the
 output. Recall is the extent to which all correct tags are
 successfully retained in the output of the tagger, allowing, however,
 for more than one reading to occur for one word (i.e. ambiguous
 tagging is permitted). According to these measures, the success of
 the tagging is as follows:

<h5>6.6.2.2  Estimated ambiguity and error rates for each tag (fine-grained mode of calculation)</h5>
<p><span id="id2367216"></span>The estimates for individual tags are again based on the 50,000 sample, and the ambiguity rate for each tag is based on the number of ambiguity tags which begin with a given tag. The table also specifies the estimated likelihood that a given tag, in the first position of the ambiguity tag, is the correct tag.</p>
<p><span id="id2367224"></span>In <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-2" title="">Table 25. Estimated ambiguity rates and error
 rates by tag</a>, column (b) shows the overall
 frequency of particular tags (not including ambiguity tags). Column
 (c) gives the overall occurrence of ambiguity tags, as well as of
 particular ambiguity tags, beginning with a given tag. (Ambiguity
 tags marked * are less &#8216;serious&#8217; in that they apply to two
 subcategories of the same part of speech, such as past tense and past
 participle of the verb - see 4.1 below.) Column (d) shows which tags
 are more or less likely to be found as the first part of an ambiguity
 tag. For example, both <tt>NP0</tt> and <tt>VVG</tt> have an
 especially high incidence of ambiguity tags. Column (e) tells us,
 given that we have observed an ambiguity tag, what is the likelihood
 of the first tag&#8217;s being correct? Overall, there is more than a 3-1
 chance that the first tag will be correct; but there are some
 exceptions, where the chances of the first tag&#8217;s being correct are
 much lower: for example, <tt>PNI</tt> (indefinite pronoun). Note
 that (f) and (g) exclude errors where the first tag of an ambiguity
 tag is wrong; contrast <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-5" title="">Table 28. Estimated error rates for the whole corpus</a>, and <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-6" title="">Table 29. Estimated error rates (by tag)</a> column (c), below.</p>

<h5>6.6.2.3  Estimated error rates specifying the incorrect tag and the correct tag (fine-grained calculation)</h5>
<p><span id="id2369396"></span>The next table, <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-3" title="">Table 26. Estimated frequency of selected tag-pairs</a>, gives the frequency, as
 a percentage, of error-prone tag-pairs where XXX is the incorrect tag
 and YYY is the correct tag which should have occurred in its
 place. In the third column, the number of the specified error-type is
 listed, as a frequency count from the sample of 50,000 words. In the
 fourth column, this is expressed as a percentage of all the tagging
 errors of word category XXX (in <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-2" title="">Table 25. Estimated ambiguity rates and error
 rates by tag</a> column
 (f)). The fifth column answers the question: if tag XXX occurs, what
 is the likelihood that it is an error for tag YYY? Where the number
 of occurrences of a given error-type is less than 5 (i.e. 1 in 10,000
 words), they are ignored. Hence, <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-3" title="">Table 26. Estimated frequency of selected tag-pairs</a> is not exhaustive: only the more likely error-types are listed. In the second column, we add, where useful, the individual words which trigger these errors.</p>

<div class="teidiv3" id="coarse">
<h5>6.6.3.1  Presentation of Ambiguity and Error Rates (coarse-grained calculation)</h5>
<p><span id="id2370114"></span>Yet a further way of looking at the ambiguities and errors in the corpus is to make a coarse-grained calculation in counting these phenomena. In a fine-grained measurement, which is the one assumed up to now, each tag is considered to define its own word class which is different from all other word classes. Using the coarse-grained calculation, on the other hand, we consider words to belong to different word classes (parts of speech) only when the major category is different. If we consider the pair NN1 (singular and common noun) and NP0 (proper noun), the coarse-grained calculation says that the ambiguity tag NN1-NP0 or NP0-NN1 does not show tagging uncertainty, since both the proposed tags agree in categorizing the word as the same part of speech (a noun). So this does not add to the ambiguity rate. Similarly, the coarse-grained point of view on error is that, if a word is tagged as NN1 when it should be NP0, or vice versa, then this is not error, because both tags are within the noun category. To summarize: in the fine-grained calculation, minor differences of wordclass count towards the ambiguity and error rates; in the coarse-grained calculation, they do not.
 </p>
<p><span id="id2370136"></span>In this section, the same calculations are made as in section 3,
 except that errors and ambiguities which are confined within a major
 category (noun, verb, etc.) are ignored. In practice, most of the
 errors and ambiguities of this kind come from the difficulty the
 tagger finds in recognizing the difference between NN1 (singular
 common noun) and NP0 (proper noun), between VVD (past tense lexical
 verb) and VVN (past participle lexical verb), and between VVB (finite
 present tense base form, lexical verb) and VVI (infinitive lexical
 verb). Thus the ambiguity tags NN1-NP0, VVD-VVN and their mirror
 images do not occur in the relevant table (<a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-5" title="">Table 28. Estimated error rates for the whole corpus</a>) below. However,
 since there are no ambiguity tags for VVB and VVI, the problem of
 distinguishing these two shows up only in the error calculation.

 the overall error rate by c.0.5 per cent. We will not present

<h5>6.6.3.2  Different modes of calculation: eliminating ambiguities</h5>
<p><span id="id2370293"></span>Given that the elimination of errors was beyond our capability
 within the time frame and budget we had available, the corpus in its
 present form, containing ambiguity tags as well as a small proportion
 of errors, is designed for what we believe will be the most common
 type of user, who will find it easier to tolerate ambiguity than
 error. However, other users may prefer a corpus which does not
 contain ambiguities, even though its error rate is higher. For this
 latter type of user, the present corpus is easy to interpret as a
 corpus free of ambiguities, simply by deleting or ignoring the second
 tag of any ambiguity tag, and accepting the first tag as the only
 one. In what follows, we therefore allow two modes of calculation: in
 addition to the "safer" mode, in which ambiguities are allowed and
 consequently errors are relatively low, we allow a "riskier" mode in
 which ambiguities are abolished, and errors are more frequent. In
 fact, if ambiguity tags are eliminated, the overall error rate rises
 to almost 2 per cent.</p>

<p><span id="id2370381"></span>The following table gives an error count (c) for each tag:
 i.e. the number of errors in the 50,000 word sample where that tag
 was the erroneous tag. [Cf. the "safer" error count in <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-3" title="">Table 26. Estimated frequency of selected tag-pairs</a>,
 column (f).] In addition, each tag has a correction count (d):
 i.e. the number of erroneous tags for which that tag was the correct
 tag. If we subtract the Error count (c) from the Tag count (b), and
 add the Correction count (d) to the result, we arrive at the "Real
 tag count" (e) representing the number of occurrences of that tag in
 the corrected sample corpus. Not included in the table is the small
 number of &#8216;multiword&#8217; errors which resulted in two tags being
 replaced by one (error count), or one tag being replaced by two
 (correction count), due to the incorrect non-use or use of multiword
 tags. The last column divides the error count by the tag count to
 provide the error rate (as a percentage).</p>

<p><span id="id2371866"></span>It is clear from this table that the amount of error in the
 tagging of the corpus varies greatly from one tag to another. The
 most error prone-tag, by a large margin, is <tt>VVB</tt>, with
 more than 17 per cent error, while many of the tags are associated
 with no errors at all, and well over half the tags have less than a 1
 per cent error.
 
 The final table gives figures for the third level of detail, where we
 itemise individual tag pairs XXX, YYY, where XXX is the incorrect
 tag, and YYY is the correct one which should have appeared but did
 not. Only those pairings which account for 5 or more errors are
 listed. This table differs from <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#table-3" title="">Table 26. Estimated frequency of selected tag-pairs</a> in that here
 the second tags of ambiguity tags are not taken into account
 ("riskier mode"). It will be seen that the errors which occur tend to
 fall into a relatively small number of major categories.</p>

<span id="id2372697"></span>Finally, we list here the text samples used to constitute the

of 2,000 words taken from the BNC texts listed below, except that two
samples, one of written and one of spoken English, consisted of 1,000

for using half-length samples in two cases was to maintain the
proportion of written and spoken data as 90% - 10%, so as to keep the
proportions of the sample the same as the proportions in the BNC as a
whole. The BNC text files are cited by the three-character code used

<h4>6.6.4  POS-Tagging Workflow</h4>

</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2372869"></span>The first four phases were carried out automatically, using
 CLAWS4, an automatic tagger which developed out of the CLAWS1
 automatic tagger (authors: Roger Garside and <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Ian
 Marshall 1983</a>) used to tag the LOB Corpus. The advanced version
 CLAWS4 is principally the work of Roger Garside, although many other
 researchers at Lancaster have contributed to its performance in one
 way or another. Further information about CLAWS4 can be obtained from
 <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Leech, Garside and Bryant 1994</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Garside and Smith 1997</a>.  CLAWS4 is a
 <em>hybrid</em> tagger, employing a mixture of probabilistic and
 non-probabilistic techniques. The fifth and sixth phases used other
 systems,described in the appropriate section below.
         </p>
<div class="teidiv3" id="tokenization2">
<h5>6.6.4.1  A. Tokenization</h5>
<p><span id="id2372914"></span>The first major step in automatic tagging is to divide up the
      text or corpus to be tagged into individual (1) word tokens and
      (2) orthographic sentences. These are the segments usually
      demarcated by (1) spaces and (2) sentence boundaries
      (i.e. sentence final punctuation followed by a capital
      letter). This procedure is not so straightforward as it might
      seem, particularly because of the ambiguity of full stops (which
      can be abbreviation marks as well as sentence-demarcators) and
      of capital letters (which can signal a naming expression, as
      well as the beginning of a sentence). Faults in tokenization
      occasionally occur, but rarely cause tagging errors.</p>
<p><span id="id2372930"></span>In tokenization, an orthographic word boundary (normally a
      space, with or without accompanying punctuation) is the default
      test for identifying the beginning and end of word-tokens. (See,
      however, the next paragraph and <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#idiomtag" title="D. Idiom-Tagging">6.6.4.4  D. Idiom-Tagging</a>
      below.)  Hyphens are counted as word-internal, so that a
      hyphenated word such as <i>key-ring</i> is given just one tag
      (<tt>NN1</tt>). Because of the different ways of writing
      compound words, the same compound may occur in three forms: as a
      single word written &#8216;solid&#8217; (<i>markup</i>), as a hyphenated
      word (<i>mark-up</i>) or as a sequence of two words (<i>mark
      up</i>). In the first two cases, CLAWS4 will give the compound
      a single tag, whereas in the third case, it will receive two
      tags: one for <i>mark</i> and the other for <i>up</i>.</p>
<p><span id="id2372991"></span>A set of special cases dealt with by tokenization is the set
      of enclitic verb and negative contractions such as <i>'s, 're,
      'll</i> and <i>'nt</i>, which are orthographically attached
      to the preceding word. These will be given a tag of their own,
      so that (for example) the orthographic forms <i>It's</i>,
      <i>they're,</i> and <i>can't</i> are given two tags in
      sequence: pronoun + verb, verb + negative, etc. There are also
      some 'merged' forms such as <i>won't</i> and <i>dunno</i>,
      which are decomposed into more than one word for tagging
      purposes. For example, <i>dunno</i> actually ends up with the
      three tags for <i>do + n't + know</i> (for a list of these
      contracted forms, see <a class="link_ptr" href="codes.html#defrobs" title="Contracted forms and multiwords">9.7  Contracted forms and multiwords</a>). </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv3" id="initassignment">
<h5>6.6.4.2  B. Initial assignment of tags</h5>
<p><span id="id2373074"></span>The second stage of CLAWS POS-tagging is to assign to each word token one or more tags. Many word tokens are unambiguous, and so will be assigned just one tag: e.g. <i>various</i> AJ0 (adjective). Other word tokens are ambiguous, taking from two to seven potential tags. For example, the token <i>paint</i> can be tagged NN1, VVB, VVI, i.e. as a noun or as a verb; the token <i>broadcast</i> can be tagged as VVB, VVI, VVD, VVN (verb which is either present tense, infinitive, past tense, or past participle). In addition, it can be a noun (NN1) or an adjective (<tt>AJ0</tt>), as in <i>a broadcast concert</i>.</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2373113"></span>To find the list of potential tags associated with a word, CLAWS first looks up the word in a  lexicon of c.50,000 word entries. This lexicon look-up accounts for a large proportion of the word tokens in a text. However, many rarer words or names will not be found in the lexicon, and are tagged by other test procedures. Some of the other procedures are:
       
       
       <ul>
<li>Look for the ending of a word: e.g. words in <i>-ness</i> will normally be nouns.</li>
<li>Look for an initial capital letter (especially when the word is not sentence-initial). Rare names which are not in the lexicon and do not match other procedures will normally be recognized as proper nouns on the basis of the initial capital.</li>
<li>Look for a final -(<i>e</i>)<i>s</i>. This is stripped off, to see if the word otherwise matches a noun or verb; if it does, the word in -<i>s</i> is tagged as a plural noun or a singular present-tense verb.</li>
<li>Numbers and formulae (e.g. <i>271, *K9,  +</i>) are tagged by special rules.</li>
<li>If all else fails, a word is tagged ambiguously as either a noun, an adjective or a lexical verb.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2373188"></span>When a word is associated with more than one tag, information is given by the lexicon look-up or other procedures on the relative probability of each tag. For example, the word <i>for</i> can be a preposition or a conjunction, but is much more likely to be a preposition. This information is provided by the lexicon, either in numerical form, or where numerical data available are insufficient, by a simple distinction between 'unmarked', 'rare' and 'very rare' tags.</p>
<p><span id="id2373205"></span>Some adjustment of probability is made according to the position of the word in the sentence. If a word begins with a capital, the likelihood of various tags depends partly on whether the word occurs at the beginning of a sentence. For instance, the word <i>Brown</i> at the beginning of a sentence is less likely to be a proper noun than an adjective or a common noun (normally written <i>brown</i>). Hence the likelihood of a proper noun tag being assigned is reduced at the beginning of a sentence. </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv3" id="disambiguation">
<h5>6.6.4.3  C. Tag selection (or disambiguation)</h5>
<p><span id="id2373239"></span>The next stage, logically, is to choose the most probable tag
      from any ambiguous set of tags associated with a word token by
      tag assignment (but see <a class="link_ptr" href="posguide.html#idiomtag" title="D. Idiom-Tagging">6.6.4.4  D. Idiom-Tagging</a> below). This is another
      probabilistic procedure, this time making use of the context in
      which a word occurs. A method known as <i>Viterbi
      alignment</i> uses the probabilistic estimates available, both
      in terms of the tag-word associations and the sequential tag-tag
      likelihoods, to calculate the most likely path through the
      sequence of tag ambiguities. (The model employed is largely
      equivalent to a hidden Markov model.) After tag selection, a
      single 'winning tag' is selected for each word token in a
      text. (The less likely tags are not obliterated: they follow the
      winning tag in descending probability order.) However, the
      winning tag is not necessarily the right answer. If the CLAWS
      tagging stopped at this point, only c.95-96% of the word-tokens
      would be correctly tagged. This is the main reason for including
      an additional stage (or rather a set of stages) termed
      'idiom-tagging'.</p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv3" id="idiomtag">
<h5>6.6.4.4  D. Idiom-Tagging</h5>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2373282"></span>Idiom-tagging is a stage of CLAWS4's operation in which
      sequences of words and tags are matched against a
      <span class="term">template</span>. Depending on the match, the tags may be
      disambiguated or corrected. In practice, there are two main
      reasons for idiom-tagging:
      
      <ul>
<li>The correct tag can only be selected if CLAWS looks at a word+tag sequence as a whole. In tag selection, this was not done, since the program merely used 'bigrams' consisting of two tags in sequence. In other words, idiom-tagging is more powerful than the <i>Viterbi</i> disambiguation  algorithm because it is able to operate on a 'window' of several word tokens at once.</li>
<li>There are many cases in English where a sequence of orthographic words is best assigned a single tag. Such cases include <i>because of</i>  (a preposition), <i>so long as</i> (a conjunction), and <i>of course</i> (an adverb). These so-called multiwords are the opposite of the contracted forms such as <i>don't</i> and <i>there's</i>, where one orthographic word is assigned more than one tag. Thus idiom-tagging here plays the role of adjusting tokenization to larger units.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2373350"></span>Idiom-tagging is a matching procedure which operates on lists of rules which might loosely be termed &#8216;idioms&#8217;. Among these are:
       
       <ul>
<li>a list of multiwords (just described) such as <i>because of</i>, <i>so long as</i> and <i>of course</i>.</li>
<li>a list of place name expressions (e.g. <i>Mount X</i> , where <i>X</i> is some word beginning with a capital).</li>
<li>a list of personal name expressions (e.g. <i>Dr. (X) Y</i>, where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are words beginning with a cap.; the word <i>X</i> may or may not appear in the matching word sequence).</li>
<li>a list of foreign or classical language expressions used in English (e.g. <i>de jure</i>, <i>hoi polloi</i>)</li>
<li>a list of grammatical sequences where there are typically 'slots' in the sequence which may or may not be filled: e.g. Modal  + (adverb/negative) + (adverb/negative) + Infinitive. This matches a sequence such as <i>would not necessarily like</i>. The recognition that the word token <i>like</i> here is an infinitive verb (rather than, say, a present-tense verb or a preposition) could not be trusted if the tagger was not equipped with an idiom-tagging component, but had to rely simply on tag-pair probabilities.
        </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2373467"></span>The idiom-tagging component of CLAWS is quite powerful in
      matching 'template' expressions in which there are wild-card
      symbols, Boolean operators and gaps of up to
      <i>n</i> words. They are much more variable than &#8216;idioms&#8217; in
      the ordinary sense, and resemble finite-state networks.</p>
<p><span id="id2373484"></span>Another important point about idiom-tagging is that it is
      split up into two main phases which operate at different points
      in the tagging system. One part of the idiom-tagging takes place
      at the end of Stage C., in effect retrospectively correcting
      some of the errors which would otherwise occur in CLAWS
      output. Another part, however, actually takes place
      <em>between</em> Stages B. and C.  This means it can utilise
      ambiguous input and also produce ambiguous output, perhaps
      adjusting the likelihood of one tag relative to another. As an
      example, consider the case of <i>so long as</i>, which can be
      a single grammatical item - a conditional conjunction meaning
      'provided that'. The difficulty is that <i>so long as</i> can
      also be a sequence of three separate grammatical items: degree
      adverb + adjective/adverb + conjunction/preposition. In this
      case, the tagging ambiguity belongs to a whole word sequence
      rather than a single word, and the output of the idiom-tagging
      has to be passed on to the probabilistic tag selection
      stage. Hence, although we have called idiom-tagging &#8216;Stage D&#8217;,
      it is actually split between two stages, one preceding C. and
      one following C.</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2373528"></span>When the text emerges from Stages C. and D., each word has an associated set of one or more tags associated with it, and each tag itself is associated with a probability represented as a percentage. An example is:
<blockquote class="display"><p><i>entering</i> VVG 86% NN1 14%  AJ0  0%</p></blockquote>
       
       Clearly VVG (<i>-ing</i> participle of the verb <i>enter</i>) is judged by CLAWS4 to be the most likely tag in this case.</div>
</div>
<div class="teidiv3" id="tt">
<h5>6.6.4.5  E. After CLAWS: the Template Tagger</h5>
<p><span id="id2373572"></span>The error rate with CLAWS4 averages around 3%.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note6"><sup>6</sup></a> For the BNC Tagging Enhancement project, we decided to concentrate our efforts on the rule-based part of the system, where most of the inroads in error reduction had been made. This involved (a) developing software with more powerful pattern-matching capabilities than the CLAWS Idiomlist, and (b) carrying out a more systematic analysis of errors, to identify appropriate error-correcting rules.</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2373589"></span>The next program, known as Template Tagger, supplements
      rather than supplants CLAWS.  It takes a CLAWS output file as
      its input, and "patches"<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note7"><sup>7</sup></a> any erroneous tags it finds by using
      hand-written template rules.  Figure 1 above shows where
      Template Tagger fits in the overall tagging scheme. Effectively,
      it is an elaborate 'search and replace' tool, capable of
      matching longer-distance and more variable dependencies than is
      possible with the Idiomlist:
       
       <ul>
<li>it can refer to information at the level of the word, or tag, or by user-defined categories grouping lexical, grammatical, semantic or other related features</li>
<li>it can handle a wide and variable context window, incorporating
         <ul>
<li>repetition of the value in (a) a specified number of times, or indefinitely up to the left or right sentence boundary (or other delimiter) from any given word or tag;  and</li>
<li>different levels of optionality: necessarily present, optional, and necessarily excluded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2373641"></span>These features can best be understood by an example. In BNC1 there were quite a number of errors disambiguating prepositions from subordinating conjunctions, in connection with words like <i>after</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>since</i> and so on. The following rule corrects many such cases from subordinating conjunction (CJS) to prepositions (PRP) tags.  It applies a basic grammatical principle that subordinating conjunctions mark the start of clauses and generally require a finite verb somewhere later in the sentence.
       
               	#AFTER [CJS^PRP] PRP, ([!#FINITE_VB/VVN])16, #PUNC1
      </p>
<p><span id="id2373672"></span>The two commas divide the rule into three units, each
      containing a word or tag or word+tag combination.  Square
      brackets contain tag patterns, and a tag following square
      brackets is the replacement tag (ie the action part of the
      rule). #AFTER refers to a list of words like <i>after,
      before</i> and <i>since</i>, that have similar grammatical
      properties. These words are defined in a separate file; not all
      conjunction-preposition words are listed - <i>as</i>, for
      instance, can be used elliptically, without the requirement for
      a following verb. (See Tagging Guidelines under <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#m4as" title="AS"><i>as</i></a>). The definition for #FINITE_VB
      contains a list of possible POS-tags (rather than word values),
      eg VVZ/VV0/VM0.  Finally #PUNC1 is a 'hard' punctuation boundary
      (one of . : ; ? and ! ). The patching rule can be interpreted
      as:
       'If a sequence of the following kind occurs:
        a word like <i>after</i>, <i>before</i> or <i>since</i>,
	which CLAWS has identified as most likely being a
	subordinating conjunction, and less likely a preposition;        
        an interval of  up to 16 words, none of which has been tagged
	as a finite verb or past participle <a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note8"><sup>8</sup></a>
 (NB   [! &#8230; ] negates the tag pattern.);
        a 'hard' punctuation boundary     
        then change the conjunction tag to preposition.'
      </p>
<p><span id="id2373752"></span>The rule doesn't always work accurately, and doesn't cater for all preposition-conjunction errors. (i) It relies to a large extent on CLAWS having correctly identified finite verb tags in the right context of the preposition-conjunction; sometimes, however, a past participle is confused with a past tense form. (We therefore added VVN, ie past participle, as a possible alternative to #FINITE_VB in the second part of the pattern. The downside of this was that Template Tagger ignored some conjunction-preposition errors containing genuine use of VVN in the right context). (ii) The scope of the rule doesn't cover long sentences where more than 16 non-finite-verb words occur after the conjunction-preposition. A separate rule had to be written to handle such cases. (iii) Adverb uses of <i>after</i>, <i>before</i> and <i>since</i> etc. need to be fixed by additional rules.</p>
<div class="teidiv4" id="targeting">
<h6> Targetting and writing the Template rules</h6>
<p><span id="id2373796"></span>The Templates are targetted at the most error-prone
       categories introduced (or rather, left unresolved) by CLAWS. As
       with the preposition-conjunction example just shown, many
       disambiguation errors congregate around pairs of tags, for
       example adjective and adverb, or noun and verb. Sometimes a
       triple is involved, eg a past tense verb (<tt>VVD</tt>),
       past participle (<tt>VVN</tt>) and adjective
       (<tt>AJ0</tt>) in the case of <i>surprised</i>. </p>
<p><span id="id2373822"></span>A small team of researchers sought out patterns in the errors by concordancing  a training corpus that contained two parallel versions of the tagging: the automatic version produced by CLAWS and a hand-corrected version, which served as a benchmark.  A concordance query of the form "tag A | tag B", would retrieve lines where the former version assigned an incorrect tag A and the latter a correct tag B. An example is shown below, in which A  is a subordinating conjunction and B a preposition.

<p><span id="id2373851"></span>By working interactively with the parallel concordance,
       sorting on the tags of the immediate context, testing for
       significant collocates to the left and right, and generally
       applying his/her linguistic knowledge, the researcher can often
       detect sufficient commonality between the tagging errors to
       formulate a patching rule (or a set of rules) such as that
       shown above. It took several iterations of training and testing
       to refine the rules to a point where they could be applied by
       Template Tagger to the full corpus.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><span id="id2373878"></span>It should be said that some categories of error were easier to write rules for than others. Finding productive rules for noun-verb correction was especially difficult, because of the many types of ambiguity between nouns, verb and other categories, and the widely differing contexts in which they appear. The errors and ambiguity tags associated with NN1-VVB and NN2-VVZ in BNC2 in the <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#errorRates" title="POS-tagging Error Rates">error report</a> testify to this problem. Here a more sophisticated lexicon, detailing the selectional restrictions of individual verbs and nouns (and  other categories) would have undoubtedly been useful. </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv4" id="ordereing">
<h6> Ordering the rules</h6>
<p><span id="id2373907"></span>In some instances the ordering of rules was important. When two rules in the same ruleset compete, the longer match applies. Clashes arise in the case of the multiply ambiguous word <i>as</i>, for instance. Besides the clear grammatical choices between a preposition and a complementiser introducing an adverbial clause, there are many "interfering" idiomatic uses (<i>as well as</i>, <i>as regards</i> etc) and elliptical uses ( <i>The TGV goes as fast <em>as</em> the Bullet train [sc.goes]</i>). To avoid interference between the rules, we found it preferable to let an earlier pass of the rules handle more idiomatic (or exceptional) structures, and let a later pass deal with the more regular grammatical dependencies.</p>
<p><span id="id2373947"></span>In many rule sets, however, we found that ordering did not affect the overall result, as we tried to ensure each rule was 'true' in all cases. Since, however, more than one rule sometimes carried out the same tag change to a particular word, the system was not optimised for speed and efficiency.</p>
<p><span id="id2373956"></span>Besides the ordering of rules within rulesets, it is worth considering the placement of Template Tagger within the tagging schema (Figure 1).  Ideally, it would be sensible to exploit the full pattern-matching functionality of the Template Tagger earlier in the schema, using it in place of the CLAWS Idiomlist not just after statistical disambiguation, where it is undoubtedly necessary, but also before it. In this way Template Tagger could have precluded much unnecessary ambiguity passing to Stage C. above. The reason we did not do this was pragmatic, that TT was in fact developed as a general-purpose annotation tool (See <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Fligelstone, Pacey and Rayson 1997</a>), and not exclusively for the POS-tagging of BNC2. In future versions of the tagging software we hope to integrate Template Tagger more fully with CLAWS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="teidiv3" id="postproc">
<h5>6.6.4.6  F. Postprocessing, including Ambiguity tagging</h5>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2373994"></span>The post-processing phase has the task of producing output in the form in which the user is going to find it most usable. 
      
      <ul>
<li>The text is produced in a horizontal format, so that it can be read from left to right across the page or across the screen.</li>
<li>The tags are enclosed in angle-brackets as follows: <code>&lt;NN1&gt;</code> according to the standard TEI-based CDIF mark-up of the British National Corpus.</li>
<li>Normally the word will be output with a single tag - the one which CLAWS4 calculates to be most probable.</li>
<li>
<em>"Ambiguity tags"</em> (such as <code>&lt;NN1-AJ0&gt;</code>) are output if the difference between the probability of the first tag and of the second fails to reach a pre-decided threshold.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2374032"></span>The final phase, "ambiguity tagging", merits a little further discussion. The requirement for such tags is clear when one observes that even using Template Tagger on top of CLAWS, there remains a residuum of error, around 2%, in the corpus. By permitting ambiguity tags we are effectively able to "hedge" in many instances that might otherwise have counted as errors - improving the chances of retrieving a particular tag, but at the cost of retrieving other tags as well. We considered that a reasonable goal would be to employ sufficient ambiguity tags to achieve an overall error rate for the corpus of 1%.</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2374046"></span>Because CLAWS's reliability in statistical disambiguation varies according to the POS-tags involved, we calculated the thresholds for application of ambiguity tags separately for each relevant tag-pair  A-B (where A is CLAWS's first-choice and B its second-choice tag). First, the tag-pairs were chosen according to their error frequencies in a training corpus of 100,000 words. The proportion of A-B errors to the total number of errors indicated how many errors of that type would be allowed in order to achieve the 1% error rate overall; we will refer to this figure as "the target number of errors" for A-B. We then
      <ol>
<li>collected each instance of A-B error, noting the difference in probability score between A and B.</li>
<li>plotted each error against the probability difference</li>
<li>found the threshold on the difference axis that would yield the target number of errors. Below this threshold each instance of A-B would be converted to an ambiguity tag.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><span id="id2374079"></span>As we report under <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#errorRates" title="POS-tagging Error Rates">Error
     rates</a>, the BNC in fact contains a higher error rate than
     1%. This is because some thresholds applied at the 1% rate
     incurred a very high frequency of potential ambiguity tags: we
     hand-adjusted such thresholds if permitting a slight rise in
     errors led to a substantial reduction in the number of
     ambiguities. Further comments on stages E. and F. can be found in <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Smith 1997</a>.</p>

<h5>6.6.4.7  Additional annotation in BNC XML</h5>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2374111"></span>As noted above, the linguistic annotation of the corpus was
    enhanced in the BNC XML edition in three respects:
<ul>
<li>multiwords and their constituent items are explicitly tagged
using the <code>&lt;mw&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> XML elements</li>
<li>an additional wordclass scheme, using a much simplified version
of the C5 tagset was deployed</li>
<li>lemmatization of each word was carried out automatically on the
basis of manually-defined rules.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span id="id2374141"></span>The simplified wordclass scheme used for the second of these
enhancements is listed in <a class="link_ptr" href="codes.html#klettpos" title="Simplified Wordclass Tags">9.8  Simplified Wordclass Tags</a> of the manual, where the
mapping between these values and the C5 tags from which they are
derived is also specified.</p>
<p><span id="id2374152"></span>The lemmatization procedure adopted derives ultimately from work
reported in <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Beale 1987</a>, as subsequently
refined by others at Lancaster, and applied in a range of projects
including the JAWS program (<a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Fligelstone et al
1996</a>) and the book <strong>Word Frequencies in Written and Spoken
English</strong> (<a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Leech et al 2001</a>). The basic
approach is to apply a number of morphological rules, combining simple
POS-sensitive suffix stripping rules with a word list of common
exceptions.</p>
<p><span id="id2374184"></span>This process was carried out during the XML conversion, using code and a set of rules files kindly supplied by Paul Rayson. </p>
