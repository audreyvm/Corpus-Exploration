<div class="note">
<span id="Note1"></span><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">The article in Wikipedia (<a class="link_ptr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" title=""><span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</span></a>) is probably as
good a starting point as any; another is at <a class="link_ptr" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/xml/" title=""><span>http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/xml/</span></a></span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note2"></span><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">The terms "POS-tagging" and
"wordclass tagging" are used interchangeably in this manual.</span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note3"></span><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The only exceptions to this
statement are: (i) the file F9M, which contains the Rap poetry "City
Psalms" by Benjamin Zephaniah. It was thoroughly hand-corrected
because the tagger, not familiar with Jamaican Creole, had produced an
inordinate number of tagging errors. (ii) files identified as
containing many foreign and classical expressions, as mentioned <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#overview" title="Introduction">above</a>. </span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note4"></span><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">In BNC version 1, the quantifier <i>a little</i> 
 meaning 'a small amount' was sometimes (but not reliably) tagged as a
 multiword <tt>DT0</tt></span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note5"></span><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In our experience, human analysts
too sometimes have difficulty resolving ambiguities such as these,
especially when using the plain orthographic transcriptions of the
BNC, and with no direct access to the original sound
recordings.</span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note6"></span><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">That is, the error rate based on CLAWS's first choice tag only.</span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note7"></span><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">We borrow the term
      "patching" from <a class="link_ref" href="refs.html" title="References">Brill (1992)</a>, although
      for his tagging program the patches are discovered by an
      automatic procedure.</span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note8"></span><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">The repetition value of up to 16 words was reached at by trial and error;  an occurrence of a finite verb beyond that range was rarely in the same clause as the #AFTER-type word.</span>
</div>
<div class="note">
<span id="Note9"></span><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">
Training and testing were mostly carried out on the BNC Sampler corpus of 2 million words. For less frequent phenomena we needed to use sections from the full BNC.  None of the texts used for the <a class="link_ref" href="posguide.html#errorRates" title="POS-tagging Error Rates">tagging error report</a> is included in the Sampler. </span>

<div class="note">
<span id="Note10"></span><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Recent examples of
concordancing tools which have been used successfully with the BNC
