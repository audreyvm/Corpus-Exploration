<h3>7.1  Why XML?</h3>
<p><span id="id2374208"></span>A design goal of the original BNC project was that it should not be
delivered in a format which was proprietary or which required the use
of any particular piece of software. This, together with the desire to
conform to emerging international standards, was a key factor in
determining the choice of SGML as the vehicle for the corpus
interchange format.  A decade after this decision, SGML is still a
widely used international standard format for which many public domain
and commercial utilities exist. However, it is in the shape of XML, which is
a simplified version of the original standard, SGML now dominates
development of the world wide web, and hence of most sectors of the
information processing community. New XML software appears almost
every week, and it has been adopted by all current &#8216;major
players&#8217; from Sun and IBM to Microsoft. </p>
<p><span id="id2374229"></span>That said, it must be recognised that the requirements of corpus
linguists and others wishing to make use of the BNC are often rather
specialised, and therefore unlikely to be supported by mainstream
commercially produced software. For this and other reasons, the
research user of the BNC who wishes to go beyond simple concordancing
or word searching activities should expect to have to do some
programming. This is another reason behind the choice of  XML
as a vehicle for the system: because of the wide take up of this
language, there exist many utility libraries and generic
programming interfaces which greatly simplify such processes as
extracting the tags from a file, selecting portions of the text
according to its logical structure, picking out files with certain
attributes by searching their headers, and so on.</p>
<p><span id="id2374277"></span>The BNC uses XML in a simple and straightforward way described in
the rest of this manual; simple programs can be readily written using
standard UNIX utilities such as grep or perl to access the corpus just
as plain text files. More reliably, programs can be written to
application programming interfaces (APIs) such as the W3C's Document
Object Model (DOM) or the Simple API for XML (SAX), using application
libraries developed for almost every modern programming language (C,
Perl, Python, tcl etc.). Furthermore, a standard stylesheet language
(XSLT) now exists which can be used to specify the transformation of
XML source texts into almost any desired format by those with only
minimal programming skills.  Information about software resources is
not provided here, but is readily found on the World Wide Web:
currently, one good place to start looking is <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.xml.com" title="www.xml.com">www.xml.com</a>. Increasingly, support
for XML is built into standard utilities such as web browsers,
database systems, and stylesheet processors offering a high level of
sophistication are readily available. </p>
<p><span id="id2374303"></span>When the BNC was first published, the top of the range personal
computer might have as much as 50 or even 100 megabytes of disk
storage and 8 Mb of RAM.  At the time of writing, 50 or 100 gigabyte
hard disks and 640 Mb of RAM are commonplace on entry level
machines. It is thus quite likely that software capable of efficiently
handling the four or five gigabytes of text which make up the BNC will
also soon become commonplace. For the moment, however, it has to be
recognized that general purpose tools for XML do not always cope very
well with the large size of the whole corpus, although they can still
be very useful for processing subsets extracted from it. To handle the
whole of the corpus, special purpose indexing software will usually be
necessary.  Although such systems exist, they are often expensive or
difficult to implement.  For that reason, the XML edition of the BNC
is still provided along with its own access software called XAIRA
(which can, incidentally, be used with any collection of XML texts,
not simply the BNC). It should be emphasized however that use of the
BNC is not synonymous with use of XAIRA. Most generic tools developed
for corpus linguistics and NLP can be used with the BNC, although the
tools may be vary in the extent to which they can make use of the
markup in the corpus.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><span id="id2374359"></span>Whatever software is used,  it is necessary to have a clear
understanding of the various elements tagged in the corpus, the
contexts in which they may appear, and their intended semantics. The
syntax of an XML document is defined by a <span class="term">schema</span>. For TEI
conformant texts, the TEI Header provides additional
meta-information. The semantics of XML elements are provided by
documentation such as that provided elsewhere in this manual.
</p>

<div class="teidiv1" id="bncfiles">
<h3>7.2  The BNC delivery format</h3>
<p><span id="id2374382"></span>The BNC is delivered in compressed format, using the GNU tar
utility. As a single compressed archive file it only occupies about
600 Mb, but when expanded, it comprises over 4000 distinct files, ranging
in size from 1 to 45 Kbytes, and totalling about 4.5 Gbytes.  Each
file contains a single BNC document, i.e. a TEI header and its
associated spoken or written text, and has the same name as the value
of the <strong>id</strong> attribute on its <code>&lt;bncDoc&gt;</code> element, for
example ABC. Files are grouped according to their names into a
three-level hierarchy. For example, all files with names beginning
AA are in a subdirectory <strong>AA</strong>,
which is within a subdirectory <strong>A</strong> (along with all other
subdirectories beginning with the letter
A). These top level directories are all grouped
within a single directory called <strong>Texts</strong>. The full name for the corpus
text with identifier <strong>ABC</strong> is thus
<strong>Texts/A/AB/ABC</strong>.
</p>
<p><span id="id2374430"></span>Note that not all possible three-letter filenames are actually
used. Furthermore, the three-character identifiers  (and hence the
directory structure) are <em>entirely arbitrary</em> and do not
convey any information about the type of text contained. Each text
contains a TEI Header which specifies all relevant meta information,
either directly, or by reference to the corpus header, as described in
section <a class="link_ptr" href="cdifhd.html" title="The header">5  The header</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv1" id="body.1_div.7_div.3">
<h3>7.3  XML components</h3>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2374454"></span>All ancillary files relating to the XML structure and processing of
the corpus are included in the standard release within a subdirectory
called <strong>XML</strong>. This contains the following files:
<dl>
<dt><strong>bncxml.rng</strong></dt>
<dd>The BNC XML schema expressed in RelaxNG syntax</dd>
<dt><strong>bncxml.rnc</strong></dt>
<dd>The BNC XML schema expressed in RelaxNG compact syntax</dd>
<dt><strong>bncxml.xsd</strong></dt>
<dd>The BNC XML schema expressed in W3C schema language</dd>
<dt><strong>bncxml.dtd</strong></dt>
<dd>The BNC XML schema expressed as a Document Type Definition (DTD)</dd>
<dt><strong>Scripts</strong></dt>
<dd>Some example XSLT scripts for processing the BNC.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><span id="id2374513"></span>The BNC XML schema, in whatever form, is primarily useful as a
means of validating the corpus files, but may also be useful for other
purposes. It may be used to process a single file or the whole corpus,
depending on the software deployed. </p>
<p><span id="id2374520"></span>For some purposes, chiefly the validation of the classification
codes used, it may be necessary to process the corpus header along with
the individual text or texts to be processed. For most purposes,
however, individual texts in the corpus can be regarded as
free-standing.</p>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2374528"></span>A number of XSLT stylesheets are provided to demonstrate some
simple tasks. These include:
<dl>
<dt><strong>display.xsl</strong></dt>
<dd>converts a BNC text to an HTML format which can be read directly
in a browser</dd>
<dt><strong>justTheText.xsl</strong></dt>
<dd>removes all the tagging from a BNC text; also removes the whole
of the header.</dd>
<dt><strong>oneWordPerLine.xsl</strong></dt>
<dd>converts a BNC text to a "one word per line" format </dd>
<dt><strong>justTheCodes.xsl</strong></dt>
<dd>removes all the words from a BNC text; also removes the whole
of the header.</dd>
<dt><strong>whoSpeaks.xsl</strong></dt>
<dd>produces a "dramatis personae" for a spoken text indicating how
much each speaker contributes to it.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span id="id2374585"></span>Any XSLT processor can be used to process any of these scripts
against any of the BNC texts. For example, to produce an HTML version
of text ABC  using the xsltproc utility, one might type
<div class="pre_eg">xsltproc XML/Scripts/display.xsl Texts/A/AB/ABC.xml &gt; ABC.html</div>
at the command prompt. Other XML processing software will offer other
interfaces.</div>
